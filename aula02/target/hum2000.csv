"So many of the women's heath issues are so deeply rooted in their culture. Acceptance of domestic violence, lack of status, genital cutting, depression and arranged early marriage are all so prolific that it is 'normal' in their world. That is why human rights, including women's health education is so very important in the quest to change these practices. The grassroots efforts and women's groups that are growing around the world, focused on teaching human rights and instilling worth to women are imperative to the effort to empower women to want and demand change. My mind is abuzz with all of the information I just read about. I am so excited to get started with this course. There is so much to learn and so much to do.",1,0,1

"I was not shocked to see that some women from various parts of the world find battery is acceptable to them. _x0007_I lived in a multi-race country. _x0007_Even in a multi race community, the women are prone to be the mother of the child and the men are to be the breadwinner of the family. Women are expected to listen to their husband. Women in the work place too faces discrimination as they do not receive any increase in salary (even if they should) but the men get it. Reason being the chances of women getting a child is high and probably wasted some human resource for a period of time. Where is this coming from?_x0007_Where is our(female) human rights? We are born equally as a human, are we not? We are not born with a tag saying \Hey, i am girl so my job is to get children!\"" on our head, right? _x0007_Who is the husband, society or gender roles to tell us who we can be? Humans are intellectual beings - we are supposed to shape our talents that was given to us when we are born. Why women are not well represented in the media? Why women are not given the equal education opportunities? Why are women not given a chance to have sucessful career in a certain company without gender discrimination or judgement? _x0007__x0007_Usually, the countries that has high gender expectations (Malawi, Africa etc, from the data) are countries that were not giving proper education to these women. My mother is an uneducated women who was part of a breadwinner of her family when my grandfather died. As much as my parents are loving and loyal parents, in my father's eyes, my mother will always be uneducated person. To him, it is his job to protect my mother in terms of financial, family, food, clothing, basic survival etc. It's sweet of him, but my mother is more than that - she's smart! But my mother happily just accept this \""insult\"" as part of her life. Education really do place a role here. With education, we can tell ourselves to fight for our human rights, and to be whoever we want to be. _x0007_I apologize if i have offended anyone. I understand this post seems to support only females, but i really do support some aspects of men. The only reason females needed more attention because as the histories had shown, only a small little change has occurred to shift gender expectations and balance equalities. Men has been given a \""stamp\"" on their forehead saying \""This is a men's job. we provide\"". Men, step aside, we women can do things on our own and lift some of your \""provide\"" \""burden\"". Because we are equally human. Toge""",0,0,1
"To add on your culture and religious point - (not sure if it's relevant but here goes~) When a Chinese man and Chinese women get married, their child will bear the Man's surname rather than both.

I questioned why people follow this? Culture? It feels right? Feel free to comment on this._x0007__x0007_Another point (on culture) is this country (for the life of me, i forgot the tribe or country's name!) supported the culture of men kidnapping a female to make them their wife.

"It is really shocking to meet women, who accept wife beating and believe they deserve it. As an African young woman who believe people should be treated equally ,I used to get so cross about it and wondered if they were thinking straight. _x0007_As I began to ask questions and learn more about the way children especially girls are socialised in African communities like mine, I learnt that from the day you are born a girl, the grooming starts, you are socialised to be the home keeper, so that you will one day  be  a good wife and able to keep a husband, a home and family together at your human expense.These are done through religion and traditions. _x0007_In most of these communities, the first person a wife who has been beating will go to is the mother or an older woman  in her family. And there, they are told how their mothers,grand mothers,sisters ,aunties and female cousins have and are experiencing it and therefore is no issue. Questions are ask to imply it is all their fault and it is something they might have done or said. They are further reminded of a wife / woman's role in the home and advice to do better._x0007_Those who are religious, go to their religious leaders and most of the leaders use their religious books to tell the women it's all their fault and are asked to go apologise to the husbands and promise to me more obedient. _x0007_Others are asked to endure because of the children. Since  in most African communities women are not economically empowered and when there is a divorce, most husbands forget about their children and move on with their life. _x0007_As a young African woman, who can relate to communities where these treatments are not dealt with  properly, I will rather say it is more of an institutional challenge.",0,0,1
"Though I am acutely aware of the fact that an unfathomable number of women in this world live in great peril, it is still quite shocking to see how a lot of countries view the mistreatment of women as nothing out of the ordinary. Very disheartening, indeed, to be informed that the road to female empowerment and full equality is long ahead of us; how the exact opposite of those things are so deeply instilled in the heart and mind of people across various parts of the world. _x0007__x0007_As a person raised by Chinese parents in an Asian culture, I have long been aware of the many limitations in which old traditions have set upon me. China has changed its thinking and attitude regarding this issue in recent years, and never have I felt more liberated, more grateful, to have been born a woman. But like all great things, the exhilaration of victory comes and goes. Half of the world's population is suffering at the hands of erroneous, senseless misinformation. As someone lucky enough to be educated, to live a life of relative affluence, I see it as my duty as a fellow woman to do something about the current situation.

"Similarly, in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, the majority of the population have very severe mental health issues, due to the trauma of ongoing occupation and periods of political violence.  For women, this is compounded by patriarchal structures that promote discrimination against women and, in some instances, condone gender based violence.  Meanwhile, many men are affected by the pressure to provide for the family and the inability to do so because of the lack of opportunities for employment and entrepreneurship.  I think both sexes have mental health issues that are caused by the gender roles and expectations of their society, which can have different, harmful consequences for the two sexes.",0,0,1

"I liked this chapter. I believe we need to empower and educate women more. We definitely are essential to human life as we bring life to the world. Men often abuse this. I wish contraception could be available to impoverished women, but would that help if they have abusive and manipulative husbands? Men need to be reminded why women are so important. Women need to be reminded of their basic human rights. This high school girl who had only been living in the US for a short time had disposed her 7 month gestational aged baby in a trash can at a local high school by me. She was from Haiti. Do you think, despite all the resources available to her at the high school and in our city in general, that her deep rooted helplessness and ignorance of her basic human rights and special care as a woman impeded her from making a better decision? Women need to be educated and reminded of their rights. Basic human rights. Women's rights = human rights -- men need to understand that and shed that understanding onto the women in their home, city, state, nation, country, etc. Why focus on women? Well, we underestimate and second guess our rights as humans. I don't know why, but I'd like to find out through the course of this book study and discussion.",1,1,1
"I think that is a very important point. What is truly a religious teaching vs what people do in the name of a religion may be very different. As a Muslim woman this point is very important to me. There are many misunderstandings of the religion that have a negative impact on the wellbeing of women. These are cultural practices not found in an educated view of the religion. _x0007__x0007_Religion can also be a benefit to health in a number of ways and there is much research to support this. Observance of religious proscriptions in Islam, for example, is protective against STIs, alcoholism, and many other health scourges.

"This is a marvelous opportunity for us to share information and get to know each other. I am truly grateful to be a part of this class._x0007__x0007_It is interesting to me how many responses addressed the question of domestic violence. I do not in any way support women being beaten by their family members. Please do not misunderstand. But I think that the violence against women that takes the form of food insecurity, watching babies dies of preventable diseases, working outrageous hours under difficult conditions while pregnant, etc. can be just as harmful. _x0007__x0007_Oftentimes in the U.S. we see the various forms of violence against women in other countries and think, \Their culture/religion/values are bad, and our are good\"". We are blind to the forms of injustice that occur at home as well as our own contribution to the problems overseas. Case in point: a careful look at the data reveals that the infant mortality rate in the US is strikingly higher than in Canada next door, despite equal access to medical care. Canada also provides much better maternity leave (I believe it is one year paid) than does the US. One of my prenatal patients is a nurse working stressful 12-hour night shifts in an ICU. Her plan is to work until the day she delivers so that she can have a full 12 weeks of (unpaid) maternity leave. In my view, this is a form of brutality against both the mother an the child. When we advocate for women to have the economic freedom and increased status that come with employment we have to be careful that we are not advocating for them to be condemned to the hardships of no longer having any social/economic support as mothers._x0007__x0007_I have found that Western feminists often succumb to a subtle form of patriarchal thinking that they have all the 'right answers' to how people should live. If only \""those people\"" in other countries would adopt their Western feminist values, it would make everything better there. I believe that there are certain things that are universally harmful and unjust, as identified in this course curriculum; however there may be many ways to address these problems that are culturally specific. Imposing Western culture can be very harmful itself. I am hoping that we will further explore these issues as the course progresses.""",1,0,1

"I concur.  It is cultural practice to reform.  Most major world religions seek further enlightenment, protection, and general goodness. There's an important concept of consensual vs committed religion.  Consensual practitioners \go with the flow,\"" typically doing things that are most easily observable/identifiable in a religious community, but do not fully understanding the concepts behind actions, and thus are thin in faith.  These people tend to be less educated, more prejudiced, biased, self-serving, and more prone to unacceptable behaviors -- especially if they have made an error or sin, real or imagined.  Committed practitioners actually do believe, love, and act upon their religion fully.  They tend to be more educated, more service oriented/empathetic, more forgiving and pro-social in behavior, and they are more successful in keeping the tenets of their belief, having a better comprehension of abstract thought and belief._x0007__x0007_Though religion does have major impact on significant aspects of culture, it is people who shape the paradigms at play.

Data can indeed be a powerful ally for those trying to make change and convince others of how important the issues are. One thing I'll have to say about \data\"", however, is that, from my experiences working in many different countries, the situation is generally worse than the data express. Due to many inaccuracies in data collection and frankly, some manipulation of how the numbers are produced, the statistics that end up in these tables can be misleading, and it's very difficult to determine how accurate they are.

The current administration supports ratification of this treaty and many other international agreements, even those not on human rights issues such as the Law of the Sea Convention.  However, ratification is always difficult in the U.S. due to the numbers of required Congressional votes and the historic segment of the population that has a strong preference not to subject the US to the authority of the international community.

Especially in certain countries that regulate what can be seen or even read in their own countries...example North Korea. This makes it very frustrating because how can we educate these women where the country is so corrupt?,0,0,1

Also, his side of the family always encouraged me to have 'lots of beautiful babies'. Luckily, I was raised from age 14 on mostly by my mother. But I still envy the 100% supportive dads that some of my friends have._x0007_   I know this is only a 1st world complaint but the old-fashioned sentiments still have a hold on some patriarchal families.

"The first chapter really did, as so many who've commented below, open my eyes. The impact of women on the world is hampered every day by differential access to the rights enumerated by the convention(s). The most shocking thing for me (though one thing amongst many including literacy levels and access to trained professionals during labour) is the power men have over women's *access* to healthcare. That and the short discussion about agency - how women have always been actors but were denied their history and the chance to interpret until recently really engaged me as did the paradigms of either/or vs. both/and and the societal values put on statements such as \it's a girl\"" vs. \""it's a boy\"".

"Just finished the first reading **The Lens of Human Rights** and given the global epidemic of domestic violence I can't help but feel that it is imperative that men, empathetic caring men, join together by reason of our common humanity to demand full human rights for all women. I fully agree that domestic violence is not a private matter, it is a public matter! It is a matter that has a tremendous impact on our society's health. Eleanor Roosevelt is quoted as saying \Where, after all, do universal human rights begin? In small places, close to home - so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world\"". I grew up in one of those small places that can't be seen on anyone's map other than mine. In that place I learned the language of violence and oppression.I watched my mother be beaten and abused and I know that as I write this many young boys and girls are witnessing what I have. My feeling is that nothing will change until as Dr.Murray so clearly states,we change the either/or paradigm. It's my humble opinion that punishment has not worked, men need to be rehabilitated and taught to take responsibility.They need to learn new ways of being. The prison industrial complex in the United States is fueled by the belief that \""wicked people exist\"". People like <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> A Wilson and George Kelling creator of the \""broken windows theory\"" are responsible for the subsequent policies that have put millions of people in prison and have seriously done away with rehabilitation. I for one believe that we need to listen to Dr. Keller and change the paradigm to both/and. What is learned can be UN-learned and one can learn new and healthy ways of being. In that light I look forward to learning from this course and working towards being part of the solution.""",0,0,0
"Hi Tara, my sense is that shifting to a human rights or social justice lens helps to frame issues that affect women in a way that emphasizes their rights (and, in some ways, their existence) as individuals that a development lens does not.  For example, looking at something like domestic violence through a development lens acknowledges the affect of domestic violence as a general problem on the economy of a country as a whole, but does not necessarily include any mention or imagination of the lived experience of being in a violent relationship.  A social justice or human rights perspective, I think, helps readers or listeners to see women as individuals, and hopefully as agents as well, rather than as one homogeneous group that is important mostly in the way they affect their country's economic development.  Maybe seeing women living in poverty as individuals can also help people in positions of privilege to identify and empathize with what they are going through, and to look for points of similarity as well as concrete ways to work in solidarity with them.  That's my hope, at least!",1,0,1

"The introduction to the course serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness of gender inequity as it is experienced by women over the world. Moreover, being born a woman is not something experienced in isolation; women often face the multiple burdens of racial discrimination, indigenous disempowerment and poverty. Therefore, any discussion of global women's health must recognise the multiple levels of discrimination women face daily and not simply address gender in isolation. This is why the concept of gender justice appeals to me. It captures the innate human need for fairness and humanity, and seems more encompassing and responsive to individual needs compared to traditional public health and development models.",1,0,1
"Ni sa bula vinaka! I am a Peace Corps volunteer currently serving in the Health Sector of Fiji.

This almost willful elision is but further evidence of how deeply problematic attitudes towards women are ingrained into larger geopolitical structures. Part of the importance of this course, and the book *From Outrage to Courage* is that it promotes and stimulates conversation and education, so that we can begin to unpack the ideologies and structures that control the way that women's issues are spoken about, addressed, and largely submerged. The continuing silence and disavowal of the epidemic proportions of ill health among women only perpetuates the problem, and one of the most important things that we can do as global citizens is encourage discussion and critical thinking about the frameworks that disempower and violate the rights of women. _x0007__x0007_On a similar note, however, I would also encourage us to keep culture in mind throughout our discussions. It is important to look at the macrocosmic proportions of women's ill health and obstacles to access and treatment, but we should also remember to contextualize our conversations within the specificities of the places and cultures that we examine. Each country, culture, and society has possesses its own unique political and economic system, history, ecology and collection of traditions, beliefs, customs, doxa and habitus that necessarily influence and inflect the roles of women, conceptions of health, and the larger structural system in which gender and health are played out. I think it would be remiss of us throughout this course not to consider the ways in which culture impacts and informs women's health and human rights. This way we don't collapse or diminish cultural difference, and the international links and connections become all the more potent and powerful.",1,0,1

Because violence against women is first of all a human rights violation.

I was involved in projects aimed at preventing and responding to sexual and gender based violence in countries affected by conflict and displacement. I must confess that I was not shocked by the statistics of the Data Sheet. Last year I undertook a rapid assessment in 3 refugee camps in South Sudan on the conditions of women living in those camps. The findings showed that most women thought it was right for their husbands to beat them if they did something \wrong\"", if they \""disobeyed\"" or if they refused to have sexual intercourse with them. \""He is my husband, I belong to him, he can do whatever he wants with me\"" one woman told us during an interview. And the same applies to female genital mutilation, or obliging a girl to get married at 13 years old. Yet what right do we have to judge or blame women who think that? They are women who were brought up according to rigid gender roles. They are women who have never been able to exercise their right to choose because they do not know that they have rights, and that they can make choices in their lives. _x0007__x0007_I've been reading through the posts and I am looking forward to exchanging opinions and hearing other people's experiences. _x0007_I am so grateful to Stanford and to Professor Murray for making this great initiative accessible to so many people around the world.

"hello from State College!_x0007__x0007_something that kept popping up in my mind was the surprising differences in attitude. For example, I noticed that women in under-developed areas differed strongly on when it's acceptable for husbands to beat their wives. The number of women who agree it's acceptable was higher than I expected. So while I think it's always wrong for a husband to beat his wife, this opinion is not global. _x0007__x0007_I think that in a lot of cases, global health consists of one group ranking their values and beliefs over another group and using that idea to direct change.

This is what stood out to me also. It is not only wrong but it is malicious that the U.S. would deny women this right.

"I want to begin with a brief examination of the language used in the “United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.” I believe that language matters and that the way that issues are spoken about has demonstrable consequences on the way we think and act within our social worlds. While the UN Declaration attempts a holistic and just approach to human rights, I find the language inherently problematic due to its preference for masculine pronouns. In Article One, the document stipulates that all humans “should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.” The use of the word brotherhood struck me, as it presupposes that the audience is male and that the primary mode of kinship and understanding comes from typically masculine relationships. Compassion or empathy could have been used in its place, but instead brotherhood gives precedence to a male-oriented way of approaching human life and human experience. Similarly, throughout the document the author(s) rely on the male pronoun. For example, in Article 25, the document states, “Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health of himself and of his family” (7, italics added for emphasis). Again, the authors are employing a male perspective in a document that is meant to be read and applied universally. The authors could have used gender-neutral pronouns, or switched between male and female gender pronouns. Instead, the male pronoun is privileged and the female one is absent, a small linguistic example of how deep the preference for patriarchy has been ingrained into international politics and power relations. _x0007_	I found the quote from Gerda Lerner’s book The Creation of Patriarchy particularly salient. It demonstrates how important education is and how knowledge is an important form of power. Michel Foucault theorized about the relationship between knowledge, truth and power, revealing how the systems and institutions that control knowledge—and thusly what is commonly understood as naturalized and normalized “truths”—essentially control politics. If you can control what people believe or think, by warping history and rendering invisible the stories of those who undermine your political goals or ideologies, then you can easily manipulate public opinion to your benefit. Part of the patriarchal project, therefore, has been the elimination of women from history, as Gerda outlines. There has been a lot of critical theory among indigenous academics and writers in North and South America abou",0,0,1
"The author of the poem, I am guessing, is Buddhist. According to Buddhism, all life in this realm, the physical world, is characterized by suffering. This suffering is an escapable and an essential part of this life. Buddhism teaches that you cannot escape this suffering, but rather that you have to acknowledge and live with it if you hope to move into the more important, spiritual dimensions that they believe in. This is why a lot of Buddhist practices involve rituals of self-abasement and pain; a practicing Buddhist actively participates in the suffering endemic of this life in order to make peace with it. Only once you have made peace with it and found a way to reach a meditative state despite the suffering, throwing off all attachment to worldly possessions or materiality, can you move into a \new\"" life. I hope this helps clarify a bit.""",1,0,1
"In general, those that live in rural areas, rather than urban areas, tend to be of a lower socioeconomic status and rely upon farming or subsistence agriculture or other forms of manual labour to survive and provide for their families. This makes people, especially women, more economically vulnerable, since we know that women have more difficulty finding jobs in the work force, and this problem is only further exacerbated in rural settings. The sexual division of labour often places women at home, where they have to tend to the children, prepare meals and clean the house. Often times the women have to fetch the groceries for meals, which could involve long and arduous journeys while tending to their children. Because rural families are more economically vulnerable in certain countries, they may not have enough food to feed their whole families. Men and children tend to eat more than the women, even if the mother is pregnant, nursing or ill. More often than not, the woman or wife is economically dependent upon her husband and may have been taken far away from her family after marriage. If she is domestically abused or assaulted, she may not have the financial means or social/family support system to escape her violent home, and thus may have no choice but to stay in a dangerous and painful situation. Some women think that their only option to escape grinding poverty and abuse is through suicide, even though many cultures condemn suicide and the families may be subsequently shamed. _x0007__x0007_I'm speaking very broadly here and making a lot of generalizations, but I hope that gives a perspective on how multiple aspects of human life may conflate into the decision to end one's life for women in rural areas.",1,0,1
"From my understanding,the importance of a human rights lens, in combination with a developmental one, is that it compels states and politicians responsible for their nation's well-being to consider the ways in which the government can and should actively intervene for the rights of people if they are being violated. Dr. Murray gives the example of domestic violence to show that under a human rights lens, it is a public, rather than a private issues, as it has been so long understood. When domestic violence is understood as a public issue, the police and the state can no longer turn a blind eye to the women being abused within their homes by spouses or intimate partners; instead, the state is compelled to act and defend the victims. The state then becomes the ally and the enforcer of rights, rather than a bystander, as it may be under a developmental framework.",1,0,1

"Karen, I agree with you when you say \all tactics and methods of warfare are unacceptable and should be illegal.\""  There's a common tendency, though, to think (or hope) that women would advocate against war if they were in positions of power, but I worry that that hope paints a picture of women as naturally nurturing and non-agressive-- a picture that is reflective of traditional, stifling gender roles.  I also think that the concept of women in positions of political power as peace makers has been falsified by the majority of women themselves who have held (or currently hold) positions of power.  Some of them may be talented diplomats and politicians, but I have yet to hear any of them suggest anything as radical as calling the legitimacy of war itself into question.  My sense is that radical action (or speech) is difficult at that level of power-- maybe working toward raising the number of women in decision-making positions is useful in some ways but can be paired with more grassroots attempts at cultural change (e.g. changing people's everyday concepts of right and wrong) on the ground?

This afternoon a woman came in having been beaten by her son even though the husband had filed a report of a previous instance of domestic violence with the police. There is no specialized training given to nurses or doctors in the health sector to deal with issues of domestic violence or sexual abuse and there are no safe spaces for women to turn if they want to escape violent households.

"Greetings Everyone,_x0007__x0007_I hope you are keeping well. My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> and I am grateful for the opportunity to learn and share with you all in this very important course. I am a mother to a beautiful and awesome 10 year old daughter. I am currently pursuing doctoral studies on a full time basis in Organizational Systems at the San Francisco based Saybrook University, School of Organizational Leadership and Transformation. I am a human rights, women’s rights and gender equality activist as well as an Organizational and Leadership Development consultant. I am very interested in exploring how leaders can create conditions for cultural transformation within our communities for a more humane, equitable and sustainable world for ALL. _x0007__x0007_My research interests include but are not limited to working with women at the grassroots level to build their leadership capacity as cultural transformation leaders within their communities in addressing harmful cultural practices like female genital mutilations that violate women’s human rights.

Herein lies the hope for humanity as evoking and creating awareness around human rights and justice helps create a container for meaningful dialogue that can potentially shift mental models of people with divergent perspectives in the direction of honoring of our common humanity that inherently makes us ALL deserving to be treated with dignity and respect through the recognition and realization of our human rights – regardless of our age or gender._x0007__x0007_The statistics on ‘Population Reference Bureau’ 2011 Data on the World’s Girls and Women are indeed disturbing.

"I admire your courage to share your views on a public forum.

I do not think adoption is the flip side of carrying an unwanted baby to term no matter the circumstances.

"In any conflict situation, it is often the women and children who suffer the most - during or even after the conflict or wartime situation. In most ethnic communities in Philippines, for instance, women occupy low status which limits their chances to participate in various spheres including political participation. Likewise, even as violence against women (VAW) has gained visibility as a public policy and public health concern in the country, VAW cases continue and remain under-reported and unreported. Women are constantly subjected to harassment, especially in war conflict affected areas, as a result of continuing war between government troops and rebel forces. Upon return to communities, after conflict-displacement, it is the women who suffered most from loss of property and livelihood, absence of potable water and health services, and the disruption of their children’s education. Rido (clan wars) between families or clans is a constant source of violent conflict in some communities and at high risk in this ritual revenge are the female members or children of the family involved who may be kidnapped, raped, or taken hostage as a way to dishonor or get back at the opponent’s family. _x0007_But on a positive note, there are also other groups or organizations similar to Global Justice Center that are working on the ground to ensure the safety and protection for women and children.",1,0,1
"The interview with Helen Stacey is very much impressive. She has explained clearly the importance of signing and ratifying international conventions as well as its relationship in addressing actual violations against women and children. _x0007_Signing or ratifying CEDAW for instance does not automatically guarantee women's rights protection and promotion. It really needs consistent lobbying efforts from civil society organizations and women's groups to pressure government in complying their obligation in the international treaties. And even if there are already some improvements in terms of women's participation in education and politics (the case of the Philippines), it does not automatically mean that men and women are already equal in the country. For instance, even if data shows that Filipino women are consistently higher than men, women are consistently lagging behind in terms of economic participation. And even if we have had 2 women presidents, women still do not comprise the 30% seat in Congress/Legislature. So when talking about policy pressure and policy issues to be prioritized, we are still looking at more males than females --- meaning, these males are the ones deciding on issues that affect us (women) all.",1,0,1

It is such a set back, for americans as well, that this has not been reviewed. What a waste in time and effort if they have to dispatch like that and especially for abortions it is neccesary to be there at the needed moments. Abortions are very important in these situations as not only does the pregnancy \""stigmate\"" the woman, it is litterally living proof of a horrible act and one can imagine that the mother and her family might find it difficult to love this child, sending the child into a situation where it could be an easy prey for child-soldier hunters and then we have history repaeting itself never endingly. generation after generation with psycological scares so deep that healing seems almost impossible. Nothing left but the body as a shell, the beauty of humanity has vanished with the soul after such torture. We have to understand that from these war crime rapes come children, sons and daugthers.

Since then, (and even before) I had always reacted to the reasons of Governments, Donors and the society in general regarding the rationale they provided about the importance of investing in women's health and education.

"Hi, I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Italy. First of all I want to thank all those who made this course possible and so accessible. I'm really eager to follow all the lessons and to discuss with all the participants. It's challenging and exciting to have the opportunity to share views with such a big community. I also want to thank all the participants who will share their own experience with us. As for this introductory part, I have to say that the general approach to the topic seems to me very interesting because it tries to link theory and practice, talking about real women who are struggling worldwide. Sometimes, when I start talking about women's rights with some friends I have the impression that many do not really get the importance of the issue and how it affects not only women but any society as a whole. I also think that even if women are the first victims, the unjust system reproducing oppression on women makes it difficult even for men who would otherwise genuinely support the struggle for human rights, to join the cause. That is how challenging it is to seriously try to address gender based discrimination. Involving men is probably the final step and the most challenging. But in some cases it is not possible to address some issues without trying to use this approach. Teenage pregnancy for example, is not only a problem of women's access to health (although of course it is also); too often it has been considered as a problem of girls' behavior while in reality, it is also the result of the lack of men and boys involvement in reproductive health programs (this is also the position of UNFPA in its latest report on Child Motherhood). _x0007_The big challenge will be in many society to involve men without reproducing the unbalance of power that they represent. Equality of rights is fundamental in this sense. That is also why, the right to free abortion is so important for women to be recognized as the first and exclusive owner of their body (that is the right to bodily integrity).",1,0,1

"Countless women and men risk their lives specifically to work for women's human rights and gender equality. As women work to reclaim their rights, they often have to challenge social conventions and deeply entrenched beliefs, risking their own alienation from colleagues and even family and friends. Much of what has been gained in regards to women's human rights has been thanks to the efforts of women themselves. They have achieved dramatic changes in laws, policies and practices even though they encounter additional risks as activists and human rights defenders because of their gender and due to the issues they address. All women deserve a life with the opportunity to be educated, to work, to be healthy and to participate in all aspects of public life. Yet in every country in the world, women and girls live within the confines of rigid gender norms, which frequently result in disproportionate access to essential services and major violations of their human rights.For women and girls to fully participate in their communities and enjoy their rights, they need a life free from gender-based discrimination- a life with the opportunity to be educated, to work safe jobs with adequate and equal pay, to be healthy, and to participate in all aspects of public life",1,0,1

"Security Council Resolution 1325 was passed unanimously on 31 October 2000. It invited Secretary-General Kofi Annan to carry out a study on the impact of armed conflict on women and girls, the role of women in peace-building and the gender dimensions of peace processes and conflict resolution. Resolution (S/RES/1325) is the first resolution ever passed by the Security Council that specifically addresses the impact of war on women, and women's contributions to conflict resolution and sustainable peace. The Security Council was concerned about civilians in armed conflict, particularly women and children, who constituted most of the victims and were increasingly targeted by armed elements. This in turn had an impact on the possibilities for peace and reconciliation. Women played an important role in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and therefore it was important that they were equally involved in the process of maintaining international peace and security. It was also recognized the need to adopt a gender perspective in peacekeeping operations and the training of personnel on women's rights._x0007_Women and girls are not only victims of war; they are also powerful peace-builders whose efforts to prevent conflict and secure peace have been critical, yet largely unrecognized, under-resourced, and not integrated into formal peace processes.

"The Treaty provides an international standard for protecting and promoting women’s human rights and is often referred to as a “Bill of Rights” for women.The International Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) enshrines these rights-and recognizes that women and girls often face challenges to realizing their rights specific to their gender. As such, CEDAW urges an equitable approach to human rights, recognizing the range of gender-specific human rights violations, ranging from sex slavery to maternal mortality to property and inheritance rights. CEDAW is an effective tool for women to advocate for their own rights and a standardized benchmark to which all countries should aspire. . It is the only international instrument that comprehensively addresses women’s rights within political, civil, cultural, economic, and social life. As of August 2009, 185 countries have ratified CEDAW. The United States is among a small minority of countries that have not yet ratified CEDAW, including Iran and Sudan. The United States has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the Western Hemisphere and the only industrialized democracy that has not ratified this treaty. The United States is one of only seven countries that have not yet ratified the treaty. By not ratifying CEDAW, the U.S. remains in the company of countries like Iran and the Sudan, where women's rights are in a deplorable state. Hesitancy to ratify this important document stems from unfounded fears associated with the implementation of CEDAW in the U.S. In nations that have ratified the treaty, CEDAW has proved invaluable in opposing the effects of discrimination, which include violence, poverty, and lack of legal protections, along with the denial of inheritance, property rights, and access to credit.",1,0,0

Cultural beliefs are often an important factor in the persistence of problematic gender roles and the denial of basic human rights to women. This can pose an interesting problem when met with proponents of cultural relativism, who might say that preserving the supposed \purity\"" of a culture or its traditions is the most important thing, even if that means denying access of human rights to women or other groups. Much has been written on this subject by scholars and activists alike, but the point that resonates the most with me, particularly in light of what I've learned during my time in Morocco, is that cultures are not static - they are dynamic, always changing. Many cultural relativists are advocating protecting a very singular, unchanging view of a given culture, when in reality cultures are continually changing and adapting over the course of time. Furthermore, there are often multiple different traditions and interpretations of those traditions within any given culture. Within Morocco, for example, there are Arab communities, Amazigh (Berber) communities, Saharawi communities, and others, all with differing views and traditions, including those about gender and the family. Those who make arguments against changes to the Moroccan family code on the basis of \""preserving culture\"" are making the mistake of generalizing a very diverse culture into a monolithic, unchanging entity, which is false and only serves to further marginalize those from minority communities._x0007__x0007_I am very excited to continue this dialogue with other members of the course as we continue to learn about the complexities of global women's heath and human rights.""",1,0,1

"Mental illnesses affect women and men differently — some disorders are more common in women, and some express themselves with different symptoms. Scientists are only now beginning to tease apart the contributions of various biological and psychosocial factors to mental health and mental illness in both women and men. In addition, researchers are currently studying the special problems of treatment for serious mental illness during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Abuse is often a factor in women’s mental health problems. Treatments need to be sensitive to and reflect gender differences.The same numbers of women and men experience mental health problems overall, but some problems are more common in women than men, and vice versa.Various social factors put women at greater risk of poor mental health than men. However, women’s readiness to talk about their feelings and their strong social networks can help protect their mental health.Women are particularly exposed to some of the factors that increase the risk of poor mental health because of the role and status that they typically have in society.",1,0,0
I am always amazed at the similarities across contexts and geography when it comes to issues of human rights and in particular the experiences of women. I am not suggesting that there are not vast differences but so many stories shared in chapter one echo strings of stories that I have heard in my work in southern Ontario Canada at a rape crisis centre. I am clear the intersections of social identity inform one's experiences of human rights but there is this thread of humanity both when it exists and when it is absent that connects us all layering our stories over geography and time. And a thread of resilience. I am really excited about this course. It has been ten years since grad school and though I have been working on the ground in the arena of human rights it has been awhile since I have had the time and space to explore the issues in an academic sense.,1,0,1

"It is no secret that an empowered, educated woman is the most effective and powerful catalyst for sustainable change, and yet women's health issues are so often ignored! It is appalling that the leading cause of death in young women aged 15-19 in developing countries is complications in pregnancy and child birth! This number could so easily be halved it proper attention was given to reproductive health education, especially sexual health - and contraceptives!

I believe a large part of this comes down to the fact that women are so often ingrained to believe their self-worth is defined by something other than her accomplishments: her appearance, her ability to birth a son, not to mention child brides, abusive relationships and sexual violence. Women work harder than men yet enjoy significantly fewer rewards, financially and otherwise.

Women are made to feel responsible for the gender of the baby, even though the man contributes equally, or it could be said, more.

"Avotri and Walters’ piece “’We Women Worry A Lot About Our Husbands’” highlighted several key issues when assessing women’s health. They identify the problem that women’s health has almost been exclusively understood as synonymous with maternal or reproductive health, which is in fact only a small part of women’s biological lives. They then reason that this reproductive health agenda often comes from assumptions about women’s health, rather than actual needs assessments within women’s communities. It seems like such a simple step, but it just goes to show how blinkered health services have been that they wouldn’t think to ask women what health problems they are most concerned with. I think this failure to consult the women is but a further demonstration of the problems with Western and foreign aid, that, despite their best intentions, often end up speaking for communities and populations they know very little about, presuming, with a sort of buried ethnocentric mindset, that they know more than the communities they aim to help. One way that the authors could have elaborated further on this problem is by providing a follow-up study in which they consult the Ghanaian women they interviewed to find out how they think their psychosomatic ills and ailments can be ameliorated. _x0007_	I found the authors’ exploration of the psychosomatic symptoms the women suffer as a result of social, relational and economic stresses extremely interesting. Though international aid organizations often focus on the epidemics of communicable diseases, and acknowledge the role that socioeconomic status plays in vulnerability to illness, I haven’t read very much literature about how the stresses of living in an uncertain and unstable social and economic environment can impact the body. A woman may be suffering from a communicable disease, with the symptoms only further compounded by the stresses of making enough money to feed, clothe and educate her family, anxieties that can manifest into somatic disorders. The description the interlocutors give of headaches and loss of appetite also reminded me of the work that’s been done by anthropologists like Margaret Lock, who have investigated the concept of local biologies. Though the Western biomedical model provides a standardized list of symptoms for illnesses that are meant to be applied universally, Lock has argued that these symptoms may not be applicable in cultural contexts and that populations that grew up under different social, cultura",1,0,1

"I also noticed the country comparison and what was said about the US. Despite it not being what we would call the strongest example, I thought it was necessary for two reasons. The first being that it humbled the book so that it is not just another piece of literature created by people in the US that choose to overlook women's issues on the domestic front. It helps to work against the classism that can often happen when people write/learn about disparities in other countries. Again, I do think that there are stronger women's rights issues in the US that could have been used as an example, but I am glad that a flaw was highlighted as well. The second reason I thought the quote had merit was because it highlighted the fact that women's rights are no longer an issue that individual countries have to figure out. More and more the lines between countries and global health are becoming blurred. The country comparison helps to show that the issues are pervasive around the world and although all approaches to improve conditions must be culturally appropriate, they also need to focus on the improvement of women's rights and women's health everywhere.",1,0,1
"I think that this Chapter relates to Professor Stacey's point about how girls in many cultures and parts of the world as seen as \fungible assets\"" that can be exchanged like goods or commodities for monetary value or favors. With the increasing globalization and influence of capitalism in the world, more and more dispossessed and vulnerable communities are being treated as objects and commodities rather than human beings. They are valued as bodies which can be used and manipulated, rather than individuals imbued with dignity and integrity. The chapter also highlights the double-edged sword of antenatal technology and the emerging questions of bioethics. Though it would seem that new technologies like amniocentesis would be a great boon to families, and would help the wife plan for possible complications in her pregnancy and delivery, there is a dark side to knowledge about the fetus. It truly is an extremely complicated issue, as Dr. Murray notes: feminists and activists are torn between a woman's right to choose and the choose being dictated by cultural values that preference males over females. To impede or obstruct a woman's right to choose is a hugely politically and morally complex problem, and yet the choice may not be so much of a \""choice\"" if the woman's decision is constricted and limited by cultural attitudes towards women, especially if the woman is pressured by her husband and her family to abort. _x0007__x0007_The issue is only further complicated by the question of bringing a girl into a world that actively menaces and threatens the liberties and rights of women. For many women, the choice most likely seems like condemning or consigning their daughters to lives of misery and suffering if they don't think that they have the means or options to empower their daughters and help them escape the structures that disempower them. It was especially startling to hear about wealthier (and often more educated) families that aborted their daughters because of their desire to spare the girls of a life of misery. I believe that women need to be on the forefront of these issues and we need women within communities to bring about change. It's sort of a thought experiment, to imagine what would have happened if women like Indira Gandhi, Eleanor Roosevelt, Marie Curie or Malala Yousafzi, all of whom have and did suffer for being women and yet used that suffering to bring about change, were aborted.""",1,0,1
"The concept of the feminization of poverty was new to me as before reading this chapter I hadn't before considered the degree to which the lives of women are dictated and affected by poverty as compared to men.

While this situation causes obvious developmental and economic deficiencies, as mentioned in the chapter, I do appreciate the lens of human rights on this issue (re: “human rights and public health are two complementary approaches, and languages, to address and advance human well-being”). Especially in a world that seems to systematically hold women back, especially women of lower socioeconomic backgrounds, I think it makes a big difference to consider this issue as one of justice, not just of greater economic gains, etc. Reading the examples of organizations that address the issues women face and help empower them was inspiring and an important reminder also that literacy (and education in general) is often the best vehicle with which to climb the socioeconomic ladder.""",1,0,1

"I completely agree with you as well.  It was also my first time reading the document and I didn't know whether to laugh or cry over just how much it is seemingly ignored in domestic and global affairs.  I agree with Geordan that it is a humanitarian ideal that does help grassroots groups lobby their respective governments toward positive change.  However, I find it curious that there are so many nations (including the US) that ostensibly support the UDHR as evidenced by their presence and participation in the United Nations and yet fail so seemingly willfully at carrying out the tenets.

Here in Bolivia where I live, I've heard many of the locals complain that while their country has a litany of well written laws very few are actually enforced, therefore leading to many societal problems, human rights violations being only some of them.

"The quote “make injustice visible” resonates deeply with me because I have only recently been exposed to such statistics and to the study of women in general. In secondary school, we learned nothing about domestic violence other than that we must not let ourselves become victims to it. However, this prologue discusses the public and the private spheres where the rights of women and children as well as their sufferings were ignored. We did not learn about women as “collateral damage” in war, indeed, there were very few mentions of women in any of those chapters in our textbooks. History below the collegiate level mentions very few women but how could human history have forgotten half of its population? Now, as the roles are evolving and changing and more light is shed on the female legacy, women’s voices are growing louder. Many Americans believe that the women’s movement belonged to the 19th century and that now everything is solved, but we are still going through a women’s movement, nationally and internationally.",1,0,1

It's fascinating (and sad) to see the variations in seemingly economically similar countries regarding birth support and maternal outcomes in live births.

"In the reading, this particular phrase stood out: \In 1992, for example, at a Global Fund for Women meeting of a women’s circle working to eliminate trafficking in women, some American participants asked activists from South and Southeast Asia what they (the Americans) could do to help the most. Expecting the activists to say that they needed more money for their work,the eager donors were awakened by the answer: “The most important thing that you and other Americans can do to help is to get the U.S. Government to ratify the women’s convention [CEDAW] and the Convention on the Rights_x0007_of the Child, both of which address the issue of trafficking in women and_x0007_girls.” The activists explained that without U.S. ratification of such conventions,_x0007_it was difficult, if not impossible, for them to lobby their governments_x0007_for legal change in such countries as Nepal, the Philippines, and Thailand.\""_x0007__x0007_This reminds me of spending a summer in Palestine working for various NGOs set on bringing peace to the region and establishing their country.  I volunteered and those Americans (and a few Europeans) in the group with me volunteered in a number of capacities.  By the end, it felt so small and, while not useless, certainly not how I could best be using my privilege and position to help the Palestinians.  I was then reminded by a Palestinian friend that the most important thing I could do to help the Palestinian cause was to go home and lobby my government to fulfill it's obligations to the UN, Israel, and the people of Palestine.  An American, effectively lobbying their government for the cause of peace, had the potential to do more than any college kid translating literature for a summer. _x0007__x0007_I certainly don't say this to minimize the cause of volunteerism and working on the ground for human rights.  However, what this particular quote from the book and my own experience remind me is that, for those of us here who have privilege in the \""industrialized world\"" our most important work is not what we can do *for* people, but what we can do at home in service to the cause of human rights and how to best translate what power we have to empower rather than save those fighting on the front lines of the struggle for human rights.

"The concept of the feminization of poverty is not new to me; however, it is important to note the differences between poverty in the United States and poverty in developing countries. Despite the vast differences between the two, it is interesting that whether it is in the first world or the third world, women constitute the largest portion of the poor. I have long thought that women's education was critical to improving equality and equity for women both in the U.S. and abroad. But now, I think this is a naive perspective. Education can only do so much -- it is the iron cycle of poverty that must be broken I do believe that improved access to education is strong enough to bring about the radical change necessary to de-feminize poverty.",1,0,1

"Response to Chapter 1_x0007_The opening quote by Eleanor Roosevelt reminds us that human rights ‘in small places ,close to home-so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world’ are in face everywhere.  _x0007_I fully agree with the argument for women’s rights to be accepted within the fight for human rights. After all, women too are human. This sounds to my logical self, a basic and simple argument.  However, when I read on page 1 that  ‘81% of the female babies who are born, will be in poor countries, I know that it will not be so easy to change, violence against women in the home, in war zones and through the media, as acceptable. _x0007_Poverty is part of an experience in which concepts around men and women develop and with the challenges of education and the ever present religious and ‘traditional’ practices, women find themselves with little or no access to the world as their male counterparts do. It was positive to read that quality healthcare can also be delivered to very high standards in poor countries (p4). So challenging that poverty must always result in poor service provision. _x0007_I like the Human Poverty Index which describes poverty as ‘accounting for and trying to measure aspects beyond income, including lack of access to opportunities and resources. This is significant as the data highlights that the women who experience domestic violence for example, come from all class, races, creeds, religions etc. The perpetrators of these acts do not discriminate. _x0007_As an educationalist, I feel that there is a strong correlation between the denial of education and the wide gaps between the men and women who are economically active. So 21% women who are economically active in North America compared to 60% of men and 49% in Latin America and the Caribbean compared to 79% of men highlight what the effects of poor or no access to education can result in in these regions of the world.  Women have the right to be educated and I fully accept that this is a ‘question of justice, of individual rights’. _x0007_As this chapter moved onto look at the categorization of people and how this ultimately comes with a value system and expectation, I was left wondering how this can be changed.  I do accept that human beings ‘have a natural tendency’ (p11) to categorize others. For instance, in my neighborhood in the UK, all of the new arrivals often seek out others from their parts of the world as food and clothing  are familiar  and , are accessible in these parts of town.

"I appreciated Akila Radhakrishnan's discussion about women's right and access to abortion after rape and the way sexual violence against women is used to break down the fabric of a society in times of war.

"I feel like all the problems surrounding women have been naturalized, if a woman suffers violence is because she \deserves it\"", \""she did something to get it\"" or she provoked the agressor. Being born female is a problem specially in developing countries, the girls are the ones who end up helping their mother with the other girls of the house while the \""men of the house\"" go to work and the boys go to school. There is always a disadvantage towards the girls. And if they go to school together, women will abandon it earlier because they end up getting married early, pregnant or their mother just need their help at home. All this problems lead to mental problems that aren't necessarily discussed when going to a doctors appointment, if they get to go to one. In Ecuador women of low resources don´t go to the doctor, they provide their own medicine based on ancient beliefs of their communities (because most of women of low resources are indigenous) and there is a high rate of death at birth because they have their kids at home. They belong to the man of the family and cant do anything without their consent.""",0,0,1
"I think it's important to think about the context in which women are giving birth when thinking about the safety of medicalized versus home-based practices.  First, among many home birth midwives in the US at least, I know that prenatal care and nutritional support are key, as well as screening for risks such as gestational diabetes and pregnancy induced high blood pressure throughout pregnancy.  Ideally, homebirth would be part of a comprehensive health care system that included collaborations among midwives, doctors, and other health care providers.  This is not yet a reality in the US.  _x0007__x0007_A safe home birth, though, has many pre-requisites that among many (though not all) North Americans are givens.  For example, you can't have a safe home birth if you don't have access to clean water, or if you didn't get enough food, or enough of the right kinds of food, throughout your pregnancy.  So although in the US there is a growing body of research supporting the safety of homebirths, with credentialed professionals, and with the assumption that women's basic needs are met and that they are being screened for risk from the time they inquire about starting care with a midwife up till the time they give birth.  Many of those assumptions, though, are not yet realities among women in developing countries, especially in rural communities that are far from any hospitals.  The best example of an organization that is working to keep birth safe and low cost for resource-poor women in a developing country is Bumi Sehat, led by Robin Lim in Bali.  Google her, she's amazing, as are many other midwives all over the world.  A good book to read is called something like \Into These Hands\"" if you're interested in reading profiles of midwives who have led efforts  for better birth practices worldwide.""",1,0,1

Despite the existing research and evidence that shows how helping women leads to better health/literacy/etc. within families and communities, we as people have failed to follow through and create big change in these areas.

It's far more \""masculine\"" to take broad swipes at solving development issues.

It usually takes a women-led organization or group to help tell these stories and capture us at an emotional level.

"It also stood out to me that women bear the brunt of poverty because of the enormous responsibilities that they are given (taking care of children, providing for the family, pleasing their husbands). In \We Women Worry a Lot about our Husbands,\"" authors Avotri and Walter argue that in order to improve women's health in the developing world, policy-makers must consider the woman's relationship with her husband and psychological stress associated with this relationship instead of solely focusing on improving purely \""medical\"" outcomes, such as child-birth. I thought that this concept was really interesting. Even though investigating the relationship between husband and wife is not a large component in health-policy in the US where I live, there are still efforts to look beyond the limited definition of health as being \""free from illness\"" and encompass a more holistic definition of health which includes happiness, social connectedness, and relationships -- things that should be emphasized when creating health policy in the developing world as well.""",1,0,1

After discussing what I had read throughout the day with my husband over dinner, we both came to the same question and conclusion. Has anybody ever interviewed the men to understand this horrible attitude, trying to find the root to these customs or behaviors? It is always important to understand what you are up against and to analyze the obvious problem that these men have. As my husband says, it isn’t because you are a man that you have some ingrown need to hurt or mistreat your wife. The reason is obviously in the culture and upbringing. I mean, all these men that treat their wives miserably, are sons of miserable mothers. And since the fathers don’t take on any responsibilities in the household and seem to be generally very absent, where does this misogyny come from? _x0007__x0007_We can imagine that it comes from the culture and other surrounding family figures or is it finally the mother herself because of tradition and cultural pressure that teaches her own son to be demeaning towards women. I remember being with and Arabic family once where I noticed that the boys in the flock of siblings were allowed to do everything. The mother was even encouraging her son to do whatever the liked because he was a son. Even if it meant being rude to the others or even hitting his own mother. I asked her why and she told me that this was the way to raise a son. I remember her words because they shocked me and made me understand that this is maybe a root to the evil cycle of the perpetuation ",1,1,1

"This was a really insightful interview with Helen Stacy._x0007_The two key areas of learning for me were the different levels and ways in which countries engage with CEDAW and CRC and the power of language in moving and mobilizing women for change.  _x0007_In analyzing Stacey’s explanation of the different ways in which countries engage with the CEDAW and the CRC, I was particularly disturbed by the category of government who sign the Human Rights treaties ‘with one hand tied behind their back with their fingers crossed’.  These countries are not fully engaged and there is overwhelming evidence that they need the following and that this probably overrides their country wide attempts to support and/or make sure that the women in these countries have the human rights which men already have.  The need to ‘trade with you’, invite international capital’ and ‘export their  goods’- all of which are great economic reasons for engaging internationally and these countries also know that most foreign investment and grants, would not be awarded if they were not signatories to this treaty.  _x0007_Stacey describes herself as a ‘long term optimist’, which I interpret as her meaning she believes in change but it may not happen for a while…  The Human Rights ‘concept’ is still a process according to Stacy and not one which all countries believes in or will implement.

They are making strides to promote worldwide awareness to change these policies, but how do we enforce following through on these treaties/laws? As more and more women take power, and become leaders, the more we can expose, educate and lead the charge in changing the laws on what should be equal and not acceptable in societies. President Obama for instance discussed last night in the State of the Union address equal pay for equal work for women in the workforce. He is also requiring access to affordable healthcare for all. As more and more women become involved in government, the more changes can be made to archaic laws. _x0007__x0007_What concerns me, however, is the fact that these universal laws don't seem enforceable based on cultural norms, funding, or other pressing issues such as war, unemployment, economic instability, etc. For instance, domestic violence is  often not discussed openly, how do we enact laws when cultural norms promote subservience? How do you encourage reporting of violent acts when you have no where else to turn/return to after the breadwinner has been detained? Countries may not have the infrastructure or means to house women who will have to leave their husbands in order to get away from the abuse.

"Just an addition to what's already been said: I think that if you work for a social justice organization, and specifically talk about your work as \rights based\"" then you link your work to the legal framework that already exists (either in the international community, or because your government has signed or ratified a specific convention/document). This means that you can use this established and recognized legal framework to hold your government accountable (if they've ratified it) to what it has agreed to do. Not only does this perhaps set a tone of urgency to the issue at hand, but it also compels the government to act. In that way your organization can \""help\"" or force your government to deliver on the rights that it has signed/ratified. There is a perspective of accountability.

But such issues as violence, reproductive freedom, and economic independence affect women in all countries, certainly including \""richer\"" countries.  Having said that, we wonder where this discrimination came from and how these outrages can be addressed successfully.  Culture is strong, and men's dominance over women seems to be universal.  And yet we do see changes on an individual level and in some societies as access to education increases and an ethos of peace becomes more acceptable and accessible to people.  Through my concern with violence (teaching the course at Stanford), I came to be increasingly interested in non-violence, love, and compassion.  And I now think that if enough of us insist on doing things differently and not accepting violence as an acceptable strategy, then things can change, perhaps in small ways at first but more extensively as time goes on._x0007_I realize that these words must seem rather \""touchy-feely,\"" but we need to begin somewhere, perhaps with ourselves, as we attempt to treat one another in more respectful, compassionate ways.""",1,0,1

"Reading the Prologue through the lens of my experiences as Women’s & Gender Studies (WGS) graduate student and feminist scholar at the University of Northern Iowa, what stood out for me was the importance of including gender based inequalities in the research and discourse of public health.  Being in WGS, many of the issues raised in the section, Turning a Blind Eye to Key Issues, are discussed in this field of study.  However, when I depart from WGS, women are no longer the subject, but are the other as noted in the textbook for this course.  When women become the other, their unique experiences and knowledge become marginalized.  Within the context of research and textbooks, women are lucky to have a section focused on them—women are literally in the margins of the text and research. _x0007__x0007_I am currently earning a graduate certificate in Global Health and Disparities and I am taking the course, International Health. After reading the prologue, I decided to thumb through the index of my textbook, Global Health 101 (2ed) by Richard Skolnik.  As indicated in the index of the 414 pages of the textbook, only 65 pages mention women’s health or health issues. I was very liberal in my calculations and I was surprised to find out that there were only 65 pages that addressed to some extent women’s health.  While I am sure that many of the topics within the text will include overlapping concern about women’s health, it will be interesting to see if the book sees health as affecting the genders equally or not. It will also be interesting to compare the book used in this class with the Skolnik text and see how the focus on women deconstructs health differently.  I think the two classes will be a good complement to each other. _x0007__x0007_Continuing to reflect upon my experience in WGS, I would argue that elderly or older women have been ignored in WGS, too.  Most of my research and reading in the area have focused on girls, young women, and maybe middle aged women. Reading that “[a]lmost no attention has been given to older women in poorer countries” (p. xx) causes me to reflect on my focus of study. I asked myself why I have marginalized this group of women. I concluded the following: I believe it is related to my experiences.  While a nontraditional grad student, I am still young and I am around young women.  WGS has ignored the experiences of older women.  Reading the prologue has helped me to realize that I need to include older women within my research.",1,0,1

"I am very surprised at some of the statistics related to the health of women in the United States as compared to those of \less developed\"" countries-- particularly when it comes to the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births and the relatively low number of women in parliament. It is striking, especially when I compare our numbers to those of our to our neighbor to the north, Canada. What might these numbers suggest about the roles that women in American society are expected to take on? Perhaps, there is insufficient access to high quality prenatal care for American mothers-to-be. The rate of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births may also be related to the high rate of obesity and diabetes in this country. The poor in our country experience malnutrition of a completely different form.

I used to feel overwhelmed though by the complexity of the problems affecting girls and women worldwide and did not know where to hone in.

"Hi all_x0007__x0007_Really enjoyed this weeks readings, as it was able to gender my existing understanding of justice and human rights. In particular, I enjoy the way that the book focuses on explaining these concepts in such an accessible way!_x0007__x0007_One thing I found particularly interesting in this chapter was a slight disconnect between the theoretical discussion of women's health - which at one point discussed women's susceptibility to infectious diseases as well as the impact of ill health on the community and family units - and the discussion of practical work conducted by NGOs in the field - which focused predominately on issues of sexual health, both from a psychological and a medical perspective. Whilst I understand this is due to these issues being more pressing to survival of the 'everyday woman', I found the absence of other aspects of health very interesting - especially given that this focus is not explicitly covered in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights(although I acknowledge that it does become evident when you combine Article 2 and 25 together). Whilst this is most likely due to the historical context in which the declaration was created as well as personal context of those involved in the drafting, it is interesting to see little mention (and potentially action) on these groups relating to female vulnerability to ill health and the impact that has on their ability to achieve their human rights. _x0007__x0007_Given that the feminisation of poverty is exacerbated through 'climate change' (and the resulting impact on food and water security), it would be interested to see if there is a movement towards the development of women's group that view health more holistically as it changes the matrix of existing threats to a women's life. I have very limited experience with the international women's movement and was wondering anyone would be able to suggest any women's groups that have a more holistic understanding of health or has any other suggestions for the existence of this disconnect?_x0007__x0007__x0007_Jo",1,1,1

"I agree with you. Here in Egypt, awareness campaigns addressing women's rights often focus on women, and neglect educating men. However, we won't see any root changes until the mindset of men too is changed. Many men in countries like India, Pakistan and others (including Egypt) may beat their wives just to prove that they are men enough in front of their families. Women can be often vulnerable in a society controlled by men, thus young men should be educated into becoming protective of women and their rights, and supportive partners instead of becoming the very cause of the threat. I'm a budding feminist but i disagree with many feminist organizations that tend to blame men rather than educate and engage them. Some men are bad and abusive individuals by nature, but many others are just uneducated men who grew up in societies teaching them that women are their properties,that battering a woman is ok to teach her a lesson, and that a woman's role in life is only exclusive to household duties and childbirth.",1,0,1

Hi. My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> and I am a midwife from Australia.  I first became interested in the plight of women years ago while working in remote Australia and seeing women often with poor physical and mental health spend weeks away from country and family to await the birth of their baby  in larger centres. In more recent years as a volunteer midwife in Papua New Guinea I have been saddened at the plight of women there but amazed at how stoic and uncomplaining they are. This course will be so informative and also put me in touch with like minded people who want to make a difference to those less fortunate.,1,0,1
"Reading the World's Women and Girls Data Sheet helps me to recognize how fortunate I am to have grown up in a developed country as a middle-class American. Although we have a lot of work to do in terms of human rights and women's health, we are much further along than other countries. I really did get the luck of the draw to be born here as a female. Since our culture is so oversaturated with messages all of the time, international women's health and human rights does not tend to be at the forefront of our minds. Many tend to turn a blind eye to what is happening in the rest of the world. I graduated from the Feminist Studies program at Stanford, and while that still drives my work in education, I am even guilty of losing touch with things that I used to know and feel passionate about. I'm hoping in this course to rekindle some of that fire and reconnect with my Stanford Feminist Studies roots.",1,0,1

That said, I somewhat disagree with the first category - I don't think it's necessarily a matter of \""not having capacity\"" (as in the example she gave of India) as much as it is a matter of not prioritizing the issue of human rights.  Perhaps it is because, as Helen says, human rights are not tangible and are a sensitive issue, and underlying human rights are the issues of culture, custom, etc. and as such, perhaps countries do not prioritize implementation of human rights treaties?  Just thinking aloud, I am welcome to hear others' perspectives/insights!""",1,1,1

"Last week, I heard a news report about yet another woman in India who had been gang-raped. What was especially horrific about this case is the fact that the elders of her community ordered the rape, all because she was in love with a man of whom they did not approve. To make matters all the more disturbing, the women in her community were siding with the men who sent down the order, NOT with the victim. I read the PRB data while this story was fresh in my mind, and it suddenly occurred to me that in some cases, women may not only behave according to the expectations of the men in their lives but might actually possess a deeply embedded belief system that does not allow for individual thought. This may be true even when it comes to crimes against their own family members and friends.",0,0,1

It is also the case that the home nations (Scotland, Wales, NI and England) have varying legal systems. For example, Scottish law is quite separate to that of England and Wales, however, the UK government which holds responsibility for international affairs is that which ratified the treaty.

"The human rights approach is essential to women's health but it is a very difficult sell (so to speak) to policymakers and leaders in developing countries who are mainly interested in economic development. This is not an indictment on the character of these persons but rather comment on the assimilation of a human rights approach into local cultures. In many cases a woman's rights are viewed through a lens of economic development and the woman becomes a means to an end. Nations create work opportunities for women which are part time, unskilled, low paying, in hazardous environments or even create underemployment simply to meet international pressure to provide work. In the some cases of women's health may not be viewed a fulfillment of a right to access quality care but rather as a means of limiting associated to a social 'ills' or financial inconveniences. I think this is because the health issues of women are still viewed as the concerns of an 'other': concerns of persons outside the realm of concern and control of persons with power (more often male, older, non poor). Working in women's health requires advocacy which targets changes in cultural perceptions of women's issues. To a certain extent the domestic violence data showing women being more supportive of GBV is not surprising to me. In many (not all) situations where women are abused, there is an underlying culture of abuse as an acceptable form of social interaction and sanction which transcends women's issues. It is no coincidence that many of the societies which neglect women's issues also have problems stemming from cultural norms which have entrenched the either/or paradigm. The human rights approach must move beyond policy strategies and and conceptually isolated programmes to become cultural movements.    The success of the groups identified depends on their and their allies capacity to positively affect local cultures.",1,0,1

"Professor Stacy is an eloquent and informative speaker; the video was very much worth watching. I had never heard anyone describe the human rights as ideas rather than something concrete. Of course they are ideas, as they only exist in the minds of those who are aware of them and chose to acknowledge them. It is such a sad state of affairs that the U.S. has not ratified CEDAW. The fact that a small group of ultra-conservatives can hold up something like this is so hard to imagine, unless you look at how this country was founded, which began with colonization by ultra conservatives from Europe. We have never been able to shake that, and it goes along with the development of the Constitution, again written by these white, privileged, conservative males. How does one change or undo what was done so long ago? Getting more women into politics is a tactic, and I think there are some gains being made here, (such as Wendy Davis with her filibuster to try to stop the conservatives from shutting down abortion clinics and severely restricting abortion in Texas) but it is slow going.",1,0,1

It is disappointing that the US is unwilling to provide the necessary health services to women who are survivors of rape in war torn countries.

"Hello Marta, _x0007_\Literate\"" means that one is able to read and write, and understand the basic sentences (I suppose something much simpler than newspaper or an adult book). And in my view, being literate does not mean that a woman is able to make a change in her life through economic activities etc., but it is a very strong factor for it. For instance, being able to count over 100 allows a woman who sells potatoes in the market to sell more than 100 without being cheated; being able to measure (many literacy courses include basic math) allows a woman to plant seeds as instructed, e.g. 5 centimeters apart; being able to read allows her to sign a document on her own (and not her husband); participating in a literacy course equips women with lifeskill know-hows as the textbook often deals with practical issues such as HIV/AIDS prevention, vaccination for children, hygiene at home...  All these examples came from the testimonies of the women who participated in a 9-month literacy course in Guinea where I worked. _x0007__x0007_However, getting a real picture from \""literacy rate\"" is difficult for many reasons, as many other indicators. First of all, it is mostly based on \""self-declaration\"" (and not a standard test!) during population/ housing censuses or a national sample surveys. The definition of \""being literate\"" may differ from one country to another. A person can be \""literate\"" right after having taken a course, but can go back to \""illiterate\"" again if s/he does not use the literacy skills in a real life immediately and for a period of time. _x0007__x0007_Despite these difficulties, I think literacy is one of the most important skills for women in the path to gaining more freedom and independence.""",1,0,1
"This was a really great way to review how social justice comes out of international human rights covenants treaties and the laws of a country. Its amazing how much of a backlash there is in the US to anything that hints of socialism. Yet in other countries it is a good notion that works within or alongside capitalism to some extent. At the personal level there is plenty of research that supports that true happiness and contentment comes from giving and helping. Why do right wing governments and parties cling to the idea that all people have personal responsibility to succeed and if they don't, then they don't deserve help.

I did find it interesting to see that the UK, and other nations, specify that their own laws take precedent over CEDAW e.g. Nationality Act (1981) and issues regarding pensions. I may just be being a bit dim, but I thought that international law was supposed to stop individual countries from implementing its own laws, which may be unfair, unjust or discriminatory.

"Hi. Having read the first chapter I agree with you so many points have already caught my attention and I have already been shocked and stunned by what I've learned. I also completely agree with you that the statement about women making history but being deprived of learning or interpreting it is a powerful point. Also how being kept from their own history has caused women to struggle against this condition. _x0007__x0007_Also you right when you look at history it does seem crazy that despite countless wars due to religion, land, money, succession etc that perhaps the longest suppression of people, the female population, hasn't resulted in a war.I like your question where is the gender war? However, looking at it historically the sad truth is that the people who have been ready to fight this suppression, man or women, have always been the small courageous few. If you start with in Europe for example the French Revolution , perhaps a famous starting point for feminism, you can see that the voices of a few women and men are drowned out by society and its hierarchical structure. Its hard to have a war when the half of the population who should automatically be on your side as women, have been so absorbed into the framework of female suppression they don't know they should be fighting it, have rights and are even working to uphold its suppression._x0007__x0007_I think maybe it makes the women, and of course men too, who throughout the last 300 years (longer) who have fought for women's rights to equality and their basic human rights even more remarkable. Perhaps it is not a war, though there has been violence in this struggle and continues to be as women are abused and are deprived their basic human rights, but perhaps it has been a very slow and type of war over last centuries, gradually building its support until it is to powerful to be refused. But looking at history it has almost always been a minority struggling for change but now whats so exciting is that women all over the world are being galvanized into joining this struggle.

"I really like how this interview manages to cover a lot of topics without losing much if any detail within, but there was a point made early on that struck me. It was about human rights mainstreaming feminism, and I don't think I quite got clarity on it. I feel as if (from a standpoint of affecting feminism) the human rights movement is largely neutral because it is oftentimes so broad that it highlights that women are human (obvi) but doesn't really do a good job of articulating the degree to which human rights tragedies disproportionately affect women. So I think that it brings awareness to women's issues, but I don't think I'd agree with the idea that it is mainstreaming feminism. It is (I feel) rather publicizing feminism to a larger base that would be otherwise completely unaware._x0007__x0007_I also love the section about how health is a human right, I think that the points made there are incredibly insightful.

"I may be able to shed some light on your question and it really highlights Anne's statement about culture. Though my story is not about abuse of women it may help others to understand how centuries old traditions are hard to change. Several years ago I worked with a young Indian girl in a hospital in a large US city. She was in high school when she started and we developed a good relationship as she moved on to a community college to work toward a career in nursing. On her 18th birthday her parents announced that they had found a husband for her and they would all be travelling to India within the year for her wedding to this young man. Through the year she and I talked often about her upcoming wedding. She was excited but nervous. She had only been to India once before as a small child. How could she let her parents choose a husband for her, I asked. What if she did not like him? I had LOTs of questions. She was just a little older than my oldest son and I could no more imagine picking a wife for him than fly. Nor could I have been comfortable marrying someone my parents had picked for me, especially sight unseen. Though a little worried, she assured me that this was their culture and in their culture daughters trust parents to find a suitable husband for their daughter. She placed a huge amount of trust in her parents that they were choosing wisely and in the end the story is happy. She is married to a fine young man and they have at least 3 small beautiful children. This is a happy story about how even though this girl was raised in the US with all the cultural \benefits\"" of a US teenager, she still followed her parent's culture into marriage but it illustrates how firmly some stick to what has been part of their culture for many, many years. She was a little disappointed that she would not get to date, have a boyfriend, and maybe even kiss a boy who would not end up as her husband but she wanted to honor her parents. I am glad we had the conversations and really glad that she felt comfortable to share her story with me. It gave me a better understanding of a practice that I thought so foreign. I still won't pick my sons' wives, but I understand why my friend allowed her parents to chose her husband.

"The data show that more women than men in the cited countries agree that \wife beating is acceptable\"" if the \""wife argues with her husband\"" and \""refuses sex with her husband\"". They reveal how much more deeply women in these countries - compared to the men - have internalized the gender norms of their societies, and how other factors such as lower level of education and lack of access to information kept women from questioning these norms, and their lack of agency further prevents them from transforming their views/attitudes about women's and men's entitlement. An important implication is to further the work of empowering women through education, access to economic resources, community and political participation, among others, to enhance their self-worth and their awareness of human rights. This is particularly an urgent and serious task if we recall that in most societies, women continue to be the purveyors of culture to the succeeding generations.

Insinuating that those that have abortions — for whatever reason — don't deserve to be parents or that those who prefer sons to daughters are people \without brains in their heads\"" is quite short-sighted, in my opinion. To think so lowly of other people, I think, reflects an inability to see the larger cultural and systemic issues at play in these situations. Things like sex-selective abortion or infanticide don't happen because a couple or a woman is a Very Bad Person, they happen because of prevailing cultural and social norms that make people feel unable to make other (arguably better) choices. I want to challenge the other students in this course to see those living with with sex preference as a daily reality with empathy -- as victims of a harmful, woman-hating system -- rather than with disgust or judgement.""",0,0,1

"I've studied this phenomenon in Armenia, where I am currently based.  I have found that, though several women cite sex preference, few perceive that a sex-selective abortion is necessary for them.  The interplay of familial and socio-cultural influences highly skews decision-making regarding abortion in the event that husbands and/or the husband’s family exhibit son preference.  The overwhelming majority of women are either outwardly pressured by family members or feel a duty to carry out sex-selective abortions for their families.  Women note that their husbands desire to have sons due to a number of intertwined factors based on tradition, such as the perception that only sons continue the family lineage and national heritage; obtain the family inheritance; provide security to aging parents; and are a source of physical strength needed for the family and to defend the homeland.  Along with familial influence and traditional mentality, factors such as the poor living conditions affect the desire to have fewer children and children of both sexes.  _x0007__x0007_I'd be happy to send my thesis and other resources to anyone who's interested in learning more about this phenomenon in the Armenian context.",1,1,0

It is an informative, educational documentary about the lives of impoverished girls living in countries (the film showcased Egypt, Nepal, India, Cambodia, Haiti, Ethiopia, Peru, Leone and Afghanistan) where education for girls isn't a priority; exploring that some of the segments deal with intense and disturbing topics including slavery, child marriage, rape, and human trafficking. _x0007_What disturbed me watching this movie were the disheartening facts that those girls couldn’t reach the full access for education (easily and sometimes not at all) due to the existentially fraught political/ cultural ideologies that their governments and societies follow. For example (bringing this example due to my nationality associated condition), the story featured a young Egyptian girl falls prey to a violent sexual attack (been grown in an impoverished area and subjected to the insecure conditions of a country post revolution time) but, rather than become a victim, she becomes a superhero. Yasmin’s is the story of the triumph of imagination over a reality too painful to bear. But what startled me was how much the political condition of a country affected the girl and highlighted that apart from pursuing a hard-sought education like most girls her age in other developing countries, she is a fighting a battle that is unimaginably hard for even any three-times-her-age woman. Yasmin doesn’t even know her right to access to education or living safely, she is rather trapped to dismiss an unfortunate event from her memory that was carved because of the unstable times of her country._x0007_This only managed to ma",1,0,0

"Chapter 1 of From Outrage to Courage highlights the distance still needed for our women to access basic health interventions and education. I am very aware of most of the issues highlighted and some legislations which are in place to assist to alleviate some of the issues. However for many of these legislations to have positive impact the need for enforcement of these legislations should be of great importance. We also have to understand the socialisation of many of us, that is the acceptance of patriarchy which is  fully accepting that only men have the capacity to lead. Many nations have maintained the traditional norms of the society, justifying the subordination of women to the private space of the home and the roles of the men are that of public leadership taking decisions which impacts on all of the society. So issues relating to reproductive health, domestic violence, education and employment of women are not viewed as priority issues as \a woman's place is in the home\"". We see worldwide many agencies are now trying to address some of these issues, but there are limitations to the impact, as many are grossly under funded. However as women we have to continue our focus on education, especially using informal educational methodologies to encourage all women, especially those who have not gotten or have limited formal education to participate in any community based training. These techniques are needed because many women if invited to attend a training workshop will feel intimidated if they are of the opinion that they will be expected to read and write the information been imparted. I am aware that many organizations do use participatory learning methodologies, but I think on a global level many of us practitioners lack the skills to impart the health and human rights information in simple terms to our women, therefore this skill is needed to enable us to facilitate the relevant training towards women's empowerment.""",1,0,1
"What an enlightening and eloquently articulated interview. I agree with many other posters that the way Helen Stacy delineates human rights as an idea rather than existing phenomenon is eye-opening. It cut straight to the heart of uncertainty I felt when hearing phrases like \human rights are important to protect because it's the fair thing to do\"". Understanding that \""human rights\"" do not in and of themselves \""exist\"", and are an idea and ideal, supported and explained by specific covenants and declarations, has eased the discomfort of not knowing where human rights stem from and how they're supported. I now have a better understanding of the infrastructure, both internationally and within local governments, that have been created to support the protection and execution of the ideal of human rights. _x0007__x0007_I also really appreciated Ms. Stacy's unbiased and compassionate explanation of the three possible scenarios of why certain countries that have signed UN human rights, and agreed to secure, execute and protect those rights, do not do so. _x0007__x0007_Lastly, I was really struck by the understanding that it's not the direct influence of countries agreements to uphold and support human rights, but the introduction of the \""idea\"" of human rights into the lives of individuals and communities that can act as a catalyst for empowerment. In a sense, it seems as though the mere introduction of human rights language into a community (at the grass-roots level) can create a space of authentic empowerment in which the recipients of that knowledge can galvanize a movement to rally for their own rights - it seems like this has the potential to create a hell of a lot of agency.""",1,0,1
"I totally agreed with this writer. My country have similarly culture and away of behaving. This is also experience by women and girls in Sierra Leone. I could still remember women loosing their jobs because them refused to sex with their bosses. Even when this is reported by the victim nobody talks about it. It is defended but men in authority. Saying, \It is because she has lost her job\"". Even women are not in support with statement of woman assaulted._x0007_In rural communities, rape cases are not reported. They are normal addressed secretly because the offender is considered respectable and sometimes the victim asked to marry the rapist. The trauma in such cases bring about a neurotic form of mental illness.

"I've always struggled with the idea that Human Rights are universal. Not that I don't agree with the idea of human rights and women's rights. I do. But I've done a lot of work in terms of Female Genital Cutting. It is a practice that I do not agree with, but I grew up in a community in which the least severe form, Type III was practiced. Clearly FGC is a violation of Human Rights, but many who continue to practice it believe that it is part of their culture and that the idea of the UN Human Rights as a universal doctrine does not take into account the cultural importance of this practice. I guess I'm trying to pose a question here...to what level is it acceptable to take cultural practices into consideration when talking about human rights and what is a violation of human rights. Clearly, practices such as FGC that are harmful should end, but not considering the cultural importance and simply using a human rights framework by itself to end the practice doesn't necessarily work. I know of one organization Tostan in Senegal that has been very successful in ending FGC, but that is also because they use more of a participatory intervention model. _x0007__x0007_Anyway just something to think about.

Goal 4, reduce child mortality, is dependent or at least linked due to the statistics that children with mothers who are literate are much more likely to reach age 5. Goal 5, improve maternal health, is dependent on girls' access to education which gives them knowledge about health, particularly reproductive health and nutrition. In educating, and empowering girls, they also have knowledge and \power\"" to make more informed choices about their own health care. Goal 6, combat HIV, malaria and other diseases, is again dependent on empowering women through health education, particularly around the spread of HIV, and putting off marriage - where marriage is linked to higher likelihood of HIV contraction.

There were 2 points of Akila's that were particularly engaging, and really stood out to me. _x0007__x0007_The first was on the topic of rape being used as a weapon or mechanism of war. I was absolutely disgusted to learn that the United States does not permit relief agencies receiving funding to provide abortions(although I'm not entirely surprised given the US Congress's -ahem, Republicans- views and attempted actions regarding women's health rights). Even in areas of conflict, abortions are not allowed. What's more is that in Sudan, as Akila spoke of, soldiers are impregnating women intentionally, yet relief agencies still can do nothing for these women with US funding. It just makes me sick! _x0007__x0007_Second was Akila's thoughts on abortion, when viewed through the lens of a woman's right to health. Abortion is one of many different procedures that may be required by an individual in order to maintain her health. As each woman's needs are different, so will be the treatment or health procedure for each woman. With this being so, ALL health procedures must be available to women. Without access to certain health procedures, cycles of poverty and desperation are perpetuated. As Akila said, in some communities, women who are raped and become pregnant are ostracized from their communities. This affects not just the woman, but her child/children as well.. and it spirals from there. _x0007__x0007_I think a big issue, particularly in regards to the United States, is that people are not looking at the long term, but rather the short term, or immediate fix. This is not the way to go about lasting change, and we need to fix this way of thinking.",0,0,0

"I appreciate this question as it is a very important and dangerous one.  To say that violence stems from \cultures\"" is a slippery slope.  I learned in my Masters \""Culture and Conflict\"" class repeatedly reminded us the implications of blaming an \""Arab culture\"" vs. \""western\"" etc.  My professor from India used the expression \""culture rides on conflict\"".  I always imagined an elephant standing on a ball.  No child looks at the ball thinking, \""wow, that ball is unstable\"" they focus on the elephant.  The elephant becomes the focal point but the real root of the problem is deeper than the visual or perceived display.  Why is the elephant on the ball in the first place?  Through my work in development, particularly in Central America, I hear the term in Spanish \""a culture of nonviolence\"" or a \""culture of violence\"" but I believe these to be general to the human race versus ethnic or national divisions.  All societies are violent to a certain degree in a certain aspect, some are more visible than others.  For instance, the invisible structures of violence that U.S. creates for women, immigrants, or in its foreign policy is hidden compared to the outright violence that a Westerner sees.  Additionally, working with domestic violence in Honduras made me realize that different cultures hold varying definitions of violence - from varying perspectives (i.e. male and female, generational).  It can be offensive (as I learned first hand) to claim that someone else's culture is violent when they don't themselves perceive it that way.

There has been numerous studies and approaches emphasises the importance of education since early age, with the focus on the increase of quotas for girls attending schools. Girls’ and women’s education is very important and crucial in the process of the empowerment and overcoming gender inequality. However, the mere increase in and quotas for girls attending schools, as just discussed, does not consider the quality of education or gender equality issues within education such as gendered books, gendered classrooms, and gendered teaching. (Jamilah Ariffin, “Gender Critiques of the MDGs: An Overview and an Assessment”, International Council on Social Welfare (ICSW), August 2004)  Even though education is crucial and valuable for providing necessary tools for the empowerment of women, if there remain other factors that constrain women, then women will not, in practice have the freedom to implement and develop their capabilities. _x0007__x0007_There have been numerous conferences on human rights and women, development, security, and peace which emphasized the importance of experience, knowledge and role of women in these areas.

"I can only speak for Canada, but the anti-abortion movement here has been moving to limit access to abortion under the basis of \saving girl babies\"" and \""protecting them\"" against sex-selection. The basis for this push was from a poorly performed study out of a Toronto hospital that doesn't perform abortions reporting that women from Southeast Asia were marginally more likely to have boys in their third, fourth or subsequent pregnancies. Having worked with organizations in Toronto that work closely with immigrant women who are seeking reproductive health services, I can say that these claims are not a reality in Canada and I feel confident saying they are likely based in xenophobia.

"The goals that relate directly to girls' education are goal 2 (achieve universal primary education) and goal 3 (promote gender equality and empower women). As for which goals are dependent on educating girls for their fulfillment, I would say that includes almost all of them. Extreme poverty and hunger will never be eradicated without education. While you can give handouts as charity to keep people from starving, if you want to end hunger and poverty in a sustainable, long-term way then you must educate people and teach them skills that will enable them to make their own living._x0007__x0007_Child mortality, maternal health, the spread of HIV/AIDS and other diseases and environmental sustainability have also shown to improve when girls are properly educated. If girls are taught how to protect themselves from HIV/AIDS and malaria, and how to seek treatment for preventable diseases, mortality rates of these diseases will go down. Similarly, girls and women who are taught about health and hygiene and given basic prenatal care will be less likely to die in childbirth. Also, by remaining in school girls are less likely to marry and give birth at a young age, which is when maternal mortality is most likely to occur. They are also likely to have fewer children, and for those they do have they will spend their incomes - which they were able to obtain thanks to their education - on their children, including their children's health. Education can also teach them how to live in a more environmentally sustainable way.",1,0,1

As the reading mentioned, wealthy males were the first to define \""human rights.\"" What might have been a right to them, might still have excluded others. In the same way, many would view traditions that others practice as a violation of human rights, while those within their own community would not. When working with communities to address practices that we could see as harmful and a violation of HR, I wonder if we'd have to approach the practices from a different angle, and introduce them as a health concerns, rather than a human rights concern.

"I really appreciate that you see this as people looking for short, quick fixes rather than for a long-term and deep rooted change. However, I disagree with you on what this change should be. I don't believe that allowing abortions in areas of conflict is a means to lasting change. Akila said that when women are raped and become pregnant that many times they are thrown out of their communities and homes (which you mentioned). This being the case, I see the main problem as how the community is viewing these women and the intentional rape, as well as the resources available to these women when they have been ostracized from their communities from outside sources. Obviously one way to prevent all of this from happening is to change the thought of rape being \collateral damage\"" to it being seen as an intentional violence against women and a weapon or war. This is talked about in the interview. But, knowing it would be hard to create any laws against this that would actually be able to be enforced, especially during war-time, I think we must turn our heads then towards the communities that these atrocities are being committed against. By moving our focus to the communities and helping to shape the way they value human lives (even ones brought on by rape), as well as the lives of the mothers, perhaps we can stop them from being ostracized. We can also start to aid women who are being ostracized from their communities by providing medical support for her and the child, mentoring, micro loans so that she can start to fend for herself....etc. This I believe will prevent a long-term change in values, decisions, and treatment of women. I believe this in the end will be more beneficial and get more at the root of the problem than providing abortions in areas of conflict will.""",1,0,1

Nevertheless, I don´t think the non-formal education is a widespread phenomenon and in case it´s, it would be interesting to know the gender gap between boys and girls (for example, coranic schools are usually just for boys...) and the quality and contents of this kind of education.

I think child-bearing and marriage are a major reason for girls dropout, as it is also true that girls that drop out of school are more vulnerable to get married early and become pregnant. Usually, girls don´t drop out from school when  they are already married or pregnant. All this is part of a planned strategy, sometimes carried out by the family and supported by the traditions and most conservative cultural values, and it happens like this: the family decides that they are going to marry the girl, then, after some weeks or months, the girl drops out of the school, and later on (sometimes some days, sometimes some weeks), the girl gets married. This is how it happens in some families in Palestine._x0007_Finally, I wanted to mention that the statement about how the benefits of schooling girls ripple out within the community, the example that appears in the text (\there will be more teachers and nurses\"" in the community) is totally gender stereotyped, and it´s prevailing typical gender roles associated to women, so it should be reviewed (why not \""there will be more doctors, engineers, or police women???\"").""",1,0,1

"KylieP...By considering the influence of social pressure, shame, stigmas, etc... on a woman's decision to abort a female fetus... and assuming that many (or some?) women only choose abortion due to social pressures, we could argue that we are protecting women's rights by protecting females in the womb by outlawing, limiting, or discourage gender based abortion. _x0007__x0007_But then, we must apply that same logic to all reasons for abortion, and consider the influence of social factors on a woman's choice in general. For example, how often does a woman abort due to the shame associated with being unmarried and pregnant, when in fact she, personally, would rather keep the baby. The same could apply to women who abort due to economics (society's idea that a woman should only have a baby if she can \afford\"" to do so, thus insinuating that poor women should not be given the right to mother), or even stigmas on family size and the many other reasons why a woman may \""choose\"" to abort._x0007__x0007_But then... back to your question, from what I have read, some women do willfully choose to abort their female babies because they do not want them to live with the same pressures and hardships that they have themselves faced. But then we go back to the question... if that woman was afforded her true rights, and thus lived a different type of life, would she still choose abortion over birth?_x0007__x0007_This makes me start to think about \""choice\"" at a basic level.

Can a female fetus benefit from \""Women's Rights\""? If we say yes, then I believe we must apply that logic across the board and afford the right to life to all fetuses. For if we do not, then we begin to discriminate against male, disabled, unwanted fetuses... Rationally, female fetuses should not be granted any more rights than other fetuses, so either all fetuses have the right to life, or none of them do. _x0007__x0007_I know this may sound harsh... but when we use logic and reason, it is the only conclusion I believe we can come to.""",1,0,1

One of the programs I came across called “Teachers of the Future” deals with training teachers for primary schools in rural areas. In the race for achieving the MDGs (“universal primary education for all” in this particular case) and under the World Bank’s pressure, the government decided that one year is enough to train a primary school teacher. Consequently the NGO running this program had to squeeze the two and a half years curriculum into one year. Sometimes students enrolling in this program can hardly read or write yet in a year they will be deemed teachers.  Does this speak for the whole program? Maybe not! The point that I am trying to make is that pursuing the MDGs could be a nice excuse and in the chase for target numbers sometimes quality has to takes a fall-back position. Maybe this was a calculated risk on the government’s part. Maybe they didn’t have much choice at the time. Maybe overall it pays. In monitoring terms they may be on track when it comes to reaching targets. Maybe the World Bank which gives the money is happy. But what about outcomes and impact?

"I wanted to comment on a couple of your points. Firstly I think in many developing countries girls are allowed to attend school until there is something more important (or what is considered more important by the family) for her to do be that marriage or working in the fields. And that is why she drops out. And it is because families (natal and in law) do not see the value of education past basic literacy that they drop out. She can read ...what else does she need. Also in places like India where there is dowry, the younger a girl is at marriage the less dowry the family has to pay, so some girls are married off at 4-5 years of age, usually when her older sister or cousin is also marrying. Then she stays with her family until her menses (12-14 years) arrive after which she is sent to live as a real wife. So yes, dropping our and early marriage and childbearing are related, but it is a bit of a chicken and egg business (which comes first) driven by the lack of value of the girl and of education itself. _x0007_The second point I wanted to comment on is your last sentence. The comment is stereotyped but it reflects current situation in most of those countries. There aren't many opportunities for girls to become engineers because gender roles and stereotyping are still so omnipresent. What is the point of a woman becoming an engineer or a police woman in a country like Pakistan or Saudi Arabia for example, where no man is going to want her as their boss, and where it is unlikely she will get a job?",1,0,1

"Which goals relate directly to girls’ education? _x0007__x0007_Goals 2 and 3 are directly related to girls’ education: Goal 2 - Achieve universal primary education will only happen if girls are also educated and Goal 3 - Promote gender equality and empower women as currently there is a great gender divide in primary and high school enrolment, attendance and completion between girls and boys, and as a result girls are disempowered._x0007__x0007_Which goals are dependent on educating girls for their fulfilment?_x0007__x0007_All of them, and the link between girls’ education and the MDG are very clear. There is abundant research to support the argument that education girls will reduce the proportion of people whose income is less than $1 a day and reduce the proportion of people who suffer from hunger. Currently women make up the majority of people living on less than a dollar per day, and research tells us that for every year of education past girls complete, their incomes increase by 10-20%. Research also tells us that women spend their income on feeding and caring for their families, thus by educating women, and increasing their income, we reduce the number of people that go hungry._x0007_With respect to MDG 4, 5 and 6 (Reduce child mortality, Improve maternal health, and Combat HIV and AIDS, malaria and other diseases), again the evidence has clearly shown that the more schooling a girl receives the lower the risks of her children dying. An educated women is more likely to seek health care prior, during and after child birth, thus reducing the chances of experiencing preventable maternal illness and death. Educated women are less likely to be exposed to practices that put her at risk of HIV/AIDS, and is more likely to be informed of and take preventative measures against other illnesses._x0007_Considering women and girls make up a large proportion of agricultural workers, educating girls on the principles of environmentally friendly and sustainable principles, as well as on the necessity of clean water will ensure that MDG 7 - Ensure environmental sustainability will be met._x0007_Even MDG 8 - Develop a global partnership for development will benefit from educating women.

"It is only a dream to those of us in the US to think of free healthcare and not having to pay for university.

I remember being treated appallingly when I was young and poor and could not afford healthcare for my children. There was no Medicaid system in my state that helped married people then; things have improved in that regard. This course is bringing back memories of so many injustices my family suffered as we were so poor. And the fact that I later became a midwife and was able to support my family well; this was only because a family friend gave me the money to pay for the course. I could not have gotten a loan (no credit rating) and to come up with the money myself was impossible. I think it is so wonderful that in most developed countries (and some less developed) health care and education are considered rights.

Monarchy is such a conservative- and in my personal opinion, archaic, but that is another discussion- institution, that it is no surprise that this article exists in the Spanish Constitution- as the primacy of a man over a woman in succession has always been something normal in the monarquies-  but it shouldn't be in force right now. _x0007__x0007_Some years ago, both times when the current Princess was pregnant, people began to debate about this article and the need of changing it in our Spanish Constitution.

The present day girl is the mother of tomorrow. “Give me good mothers and I will give you a great nation” -Napoleon_x0007_She is the most crucial and reverend entity. She must be given all the necessary education. Ignoring her, keeping her illiterate means we are creating an illiterate and ignorant generation. So it is perfectly true that educating a girl child means educating a family.Development cannot be accelerated unless girls are given right education in right direction.",1,0,1

"I can't say that I'm surprised by all of the infanticde, but maybe just disappointed that it has continued for so long. It doesn make me want to compare somem of the statistics to those in more developed countries- for example, are parents more likely to split up in the US if they have a girl? And what can we do about it? The problem is the culture and what is seen as \good\"" or \""bad\"" as well as what makes a child rewarding and beneficial to the family.

"Out of the 8 goals included in the United Nations' Millennium Goals, I would say that goals 2 and 3 most directly relate to girls' education. The second one states that it aims to achieve universal primary education, ensuring that every child--both boys and girls--have the opportunity to complete their standard education requirement. Meanwhile, the third goal strives to promote gender equality and empower women. This, without a shadow of a doubt, includes equal, undiscriminating, unsexist access to education. After all, education *is* the first step upon the path to a bright future. _x0007__x0007_Although there are only 2 goals that directly related to girls' and women's education, personally I think goals 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8 are also all dependent on educating girls or their fulfillment. For example, in goal number 1, if we are to eradicate hunger and poverty, the way to do that is to enable women to be able to work. And if they are educated, preferably past secondary school, the work they are able to find would pay them much more, even more than their male counterparts on most occasion. Another example is the sixth goal (\Combat HIV and AIDS, malaria and other diseases\""). Educated women, especially those who are mothers, would be literate and knowledgable enough to understand the warnings and directions told by officials in the prevention of these infectious and transmittable diseases. If they are educated, these women would significantly help reduce the number of those negatively affected by the diseases stated.""",1,0,1

My opinion is that women, around us,  today do not deal with unterstanding of problem  and also not deal with on a sufficiently essence way._x0007_Education and awareness are essential through  changing  discourse of story. Key issues are related to improving the life of the “small women”  .

In Serbia women still do not understand why they are not having the same wrights I also think most of them do not realize this fact. _x0007_Therefore they can not understand themselves or their right to choose their life.

I could speculate on the reasons for our failure to ratify CEDAW, but the reality is that we are still very much a patriarchal society. To ratify would be to loosen the hold that the patriarchy has on our society and that is something that those in power just don't want to do.

The 8th goal addresses the special needs of the countries as well as making concerted efforts to improve accessibility of youth.

The reading also referenced that the increase in education by even one year helped to reduce the mortality of a woman's children. Also by increasing the education of women, you are increasing her ability to make decisions about her reproductive health in a manner that will usually also decrease child mortality. Which effectively channels goal number 5. On top of that, being able to effectively combat HIV/AIDS means that a country needs to provide better access to education and resources so that the contraction of the disease is much lower. On top of that, if the rate of HIV/AIDS slows and is even one day (hopefully) eliminated, it will provide girls the opportunity to stay in school longer, rather than becoming heads of households.""",1,0,1

"I thought “Chapter Three,” “New Goals: The Power of Educating Girls” and “The Critical Role of Youth in Global Development” offered a well-rounded and holistic assessment not only of the necessity of universal education for women and girls around the world, but the social, reproductive, economic, medical and political developments and benefits education will bring, not only to women but to the world. I particularly appreciated “The Power of Educating Girls” point that while education can empower girls and bring about more equitable gender developments and progress, the way we educate girls also needs to be considered. As we know, education, as powerful as it can be, is not a panacea and multiple pedagogical approaches need to be considered if we truly want to impact and bring about change. How we teach is just as important as what we teach. The efficacy of education is to some extent contingent upon the method of its transmission and reception. _x0007_	The readings this week also addressed the need for complementary social developments if we truly hope to transform the conditions that prevent or obstruct education for young girls. “The Power of Educating Girls” mentions training mothers and I wonder how much work is being done in these various countries to promote a family environment supportive of and conducive to continued education throughout late adolescence. The elimination of obstacles like financial burdens and transportation are important short-term solutions, but discussions about social transformation also need to address the attitudes of the parents and family members of the children. If parents value girls as domestic laborers rather than students, then they aren’t likely to encourage their child’s continued education. The question is how to present education as a cultural boon to the family, which may be a difficult sell in countries where even well-educated students and adults still cannot find good jobs or steady employment. _x0007_	“The Power of Educating Girls” also examines the possible obstacle of menstruation to school attendance. They identified schools that provided sanitary napkins and moon cups for free to female students, although they noted that this dispensation didn’t seem to affect the rate of attendance among girls. This assessment, however, seems partial, as it only looks at the physical dimensions of menstruation.

Simply offering educational opportunities to young girls doesn't eliminate a problem but introduces new challenges in terms of the type of education she is receiving and encouraging/supporting her as she makes her way into the system. There are far too many barriers preventing young girls from wanting to be educated, let alone addressing the financial problems that may prevent them from going to a school in the first place, whether it's the cultural discouragement by enforcing gender stereotypes in the system or lack of representation/role models for girls to look up to.

It ain't free because each child has to provide a uniform and school supplies to be able to attend school and it is not universal because no one checks that all kids are enrolled or follows their attendance or finds out why a certain kid has not showed up at school for a long time or dropped out all together._x0007__x0007_I am involved with a non profit (www.Cambodianchildsdream.org) that builds water wells, sanitation and suppoerts education and health in a rural commune close to Siem Reap. We work in a few village schools by providing scholarships, extra pay for teachers, playgrounds, libraries, free breakfast, and English classes. At any given time I have no idea how many kids are coming to class and what is the size of our classes, in particular English classes that we pay for in full and support. There might be 15 or 50 students on any given day. The registarion process at the begining of school year  is a week long process with kids coming in whenever to register. Some never show up again for class and some only show up ocassionally. Many repeat grades and many drop out all together. So how does that contribute to reliable statistics? Some teachers themsleves don't show up for class and often kids are left unattended for hours in classrooms or on the playground. Not surprising as teachers are payed abismally or not at all. There are somethimes clasrooms provided but no desks or any other supplies._x0007_Yet, give these kids a book and some crayons or blocks and puzzles and they are so eager to learn one could cry watching their little eyes shine with new discoveries. _x0007_Ad to the conundrum unoficial schools held in pagodas for orphans and very poor kids, or private schools built and run by NGOs or local benefactors-do these get counted in statistics?_x0007__x0007_On another statistical note I have just travelled through ETHIOPIA where government is doing a huge push for universal education.

"I am a Canadian working in India and here too I see the Prussian model in the school systems.  Access to education is improving and in fact, fairly good here, but it is so much based on rote memorization.  I am working in the health field, but experienced this rote learning when I was teaching nursing students.  For example, the students had memorized things to write on a patient's chart without really understanding what it meant, in terms of treatment of care.  In the nursing school, the focus of the curriculum, the tutors, and all the classes was on ensuring that the students passed the board exams each year.  Unfortunately, this resulted in nurses who were good at remembering things, but not as good at applying it, and not good at all at thinking on their own about it.  Fortunately, the Board itself recognized the problem and changed the curriculum to introduce more analytical work and exams that did not rely totally on memorization, but on looking at a situation and developing an approach to deal with it.  Encouraging, but still a long way to go -- especially since they have to get over the culture that says that women should not question (especially men or even women of higher status)._x0007__x0007_On a different track, I very much liked Wu Qinn's approach to education and human rights, and was struck by her comment that \When you educate a girl, you educate a family.\""  I have seen this to be so true in the community development work done by the hospitals in the association I am working with.  Training women in nutrition or sanitation or malaria prevention meant that the whole family practiced what was taught and the approach was much more effective than training the men.  I think we must explore the informal education routes so that many more women and girls can learn what they need to in order to take an active part in their community and society.  The formation of self-help groups has made a big difference for the women in some communities, and I think we need to look at doing more things like that._x0007__x0007_My question is this -- how can informal education projects like this for women be made part of a country's education system, so it is mainstream and ongoing, not just project by project?""",1,1,1

"I found the report and the infographic very interesting and I'd like to comment on some ideas they exposed._x0007_I share the concern about the economic approach in the infographic, although I think it can be understood in terms of a further element for the debate on girls' education._x0007_For sure girls' education is a question of rights and equality, but the report shows also how investments in this area are still insufficient. To attract investments and to raise policy concerns, it is also necessary to integrate an economic perspective in the debate.

But I think that the report showed also the interplay between economic distress and gender inequality. As for many other debates (for instance the one about death penalty) also the call for investments in girls' education cannot be only justified through a justice perspective but must also be supported by a large array of elements that highlight its importance. As we learned in the first week, some rights are positive rights and need money and investments from the State, and girls' education is one of them._x0007__x0007_A supportive legal framework, as underlined in the report, is also important in this sense because to change a reality of injustice and marginalization for girls, all the actors and all the parts of society must come together and give their support. _x0007_Adopting a human rights perspective as integrated in the larger concern for social and political change, also means that the integration of girls in education must be assessed in terms of the real impact this change has on their lives and society. In this sense, I agree on the fact that it is fundamental to evaluate the quality of the education offered in terms of marketable skills and real impact on gender inequalities. Education is a powerful tool and it can also negatively influence society with regard to expected gender roles and gender inequalities. Education must be gender transformative, and this concern must be considered as a target to attain in education programs. _x0007__x0007_In this regard, I would like to highlight an aspect that is just mentioned in the report but that I consider would need a further analysis.

"Sorry to go off topic but I found the interview with Lynn Murphy to be very engrossing and there was no discussion forum about it, so thought I'd talk about it here. I thought it was interesting to know that girls who surpass that first hurdle of being able to go to school still face problems while they are at school, or making their way to school, as talked about in chapter 3. I guess I'm not overly surprised that girls are being discriminated against by teachers who don't feel they should be there, or seeing textbooks that are implicitly, or perhaps even explicitly, showing gender stereotypes. Could this be the reason, or at least part of the reason, that girls are not going on to secondary schooling? I understand that much of the problem is financial and they cannot afford to go on, but the fact that they are perhaps under-performing at primary schooling could be because of their social setting within the school and feeling like they should not be there. I do think more should be done about the schooling system in order for there to be more female teachers who can go on to be 'role models' for the girls, or maybe ensuring the safety of girls within the school environment so that it does not effect their learning.",1,1,1

"Australia has universal health care called Medicare which means that regardless of how rich or poor you are, everyone has access to health care for free. For example if we have an emergency we go to the ER, they take care of us, if we need to be admitted that is also done, when we are ready to leave they scan our Medicare card, we sign a paper that says the care was for us and off we go. For elective health issues (non-life threatening) such as a knee replacement there are waiting lists which can last from a few months to a couple of years but the surgery would be free. Going to the GP is also subsidised but most people have to pay a gap fee as GPs charge more than the Medicare allocated fee. The gap can be between 10 -50 bucks (sorry for some reason it does not like it if I use the dollar symbol).  If you are on welfare you get a health care card which means that even GP trips are covered although the current government is talking about introducing a minimal 5 dollar fee for welfare recipients as well. On top of this we have PBS which is the Pharmaceutical benefits scheme, so those on welfare or seniors get all their medications subsidised and have to pay only about 5 bucks per medication. Medications are subsidised for most people as well although those not on welfare need to pay more, on average between 30-40 dollars per prescription._x0007__x0007_The welfare system has different categories of welfare.

The reasoning is that the girl child will get married and take on the husband`s name and thus does not lead to the protection and continuancy of the father`s family and family name.

I had no idea that half the world population was under 25 years of age with these percentages increasing.

"I found the inclusion of the non-formal education system as one of the most persuasive aspects of Lloyd's research paper. This was a concept that I had previously never heard of and my initial reading made me think that this concept was similar to the informal labour markets - in that it was an alternative service that was completly outside of the existing government and private run service. However, the realisation that this term was used as an umbrella term for alternative and complementary services made me realise the innovation that has gone into providing education in countries with historically low rates of literacy and standards of living. I agree with Lloyd that is particularly important to find out whether such organisation are effective in providing classes for those who have previously fallen outside of the formal education system. One aspect I thought was particularly persuasive was the attempt to bring vocational skills into these non-formal organisations - as it shows that education acts as a conversion factor within the greater narrative of ones life._x0007__x0007_One issue this idea brought up for me was that there is a major conflict between quantity vs. quality within the provision of education. I've always had an issue with proxy's used for data collection in indexes such as the human development index or the multi-dimensional poverty index - in terms of disagreeing with them and/or not understanding the data collected (I still have very limited understanding of what GER actually means). I felt that these articles helped to explain why such indicators(attendance, enrolment etc.) are used to access gender equality within education, whilst quality of the education is slowly becoming a greater issue for the provision of free education - as in there is a growth from numbers to the quality of learning experienced. I found the argument of most persuasive within Lloyd (p.42), where it was able to use economic arguments to complement the right to education.",1,0,1

One day I was in a house with young children who were scrubbing pots and cleaning and talking about how they couldn't wait until they were old enough to go to school so they didn't have to stay home and work.

As Lloyd and the other authors highlight (in Chapter 2 I think) quality is not really measured and in this case I wonder how well non-formal education programs can be evaluated. I mean, I can imagine that exclusive religious education (whatever the religion is) is probably not the best way to enhance skills in critical thinking or gender social norms (which are both shown as being really important in Chapter 3).

But..._x0007_Let’s say we convince a poor family with 3 children (2 boys and 1 girl, parents haven’t had any education) to send their girl to primary school as well. First, they didn’t want to because of all known reasons… no money, girl is needed for work at home, extra costs, girls don't need education, they are supposed to stay at home and/or get married, etc.  _x0007_So let’s consider them convinced and the girl starts attending school. After primary school the family decides that this is enough because they heard that after this period their girl would be literate.

We see children, every day, who attend school until the age of 14 or older – and! – they can’t (!!!) read and write._x0007_We can’t make poor families pay all these fees and then they have a result that is a knockdown.  In so many cases, families pay for nothing!

I completely agree with the report when it underlines that \""while primary schooling is a basic need for all children, education for adolescents can be transformative\"".

We learned this from previous readings such as the infographic which reads: A child who's mother can read is 50% more likely to live past age 5. Goal 6, to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS. This goal is dependent on girls' education because it can be tackled from education on safer sex practices and according to article \""New Lessons\"" educating girls can delay when girls begin to have sexual intercourse. Another reading predicts that educated girls are more likely to enter into stable marriages therefore reducing her exposure to HIV/AIDS from the partner that she is practicing monogamy with. _x0007__x0007_As I read I find myself taking on a skeptic point of view sometimes. Skeptical that by making school available to all children everywhere we are solving the problem. I think quality over quantity is very relevant here. School can be a total drag.

The first two are obvious, but the reason I picked Goal #8, about global partnership for development, is because it details the following: \In co operation with developing countries, develop and implement strategies for decent and productive work for you.' The reason I see this as being pertinent is because most work needs at least some basic training, and the higher education a person has, the better job they are qualified for, therefore the more they will be paid etc. It's an upward ladder which has significant and far reaching benefits and effects, such as changing the perspectives of the individual, for any children she might have, and even contribute to the economic status of her country.

The challenges to MDG progress are faced by women, men, girls, and boys on a daily basis and require innovative solutions for which critical thinking and analysis are absolutely necessary.

"Throughout all of the readings one thing has struck me as more interesting, or rather captured my imagination and thoughts more, than any other statistic or fact that was highlighted in all of the data presented - that girls' learning and achievement is directly affected by the attitudes of the teachers and school towards their education, whereas there seems to be no such link with boys learning outcomes._x0007__x0007_I discussed this briefly with a friend who trained to be a secondary teacher last year in London UK, and he verified this fact with his own experiences and anecdotes._x0007__x0007_I wonder why this is, what is it about the raising of girls, or their genetic make up (although I doubt it has too much to do with biology) that makes them respond favourably to preordained ideas about their capabilities? For example in an equitable teaching/learning environment they retain information better, are likely to stay in school longer and achieve higher grades; whilst when in an environment where their willingness to learn or attend school is scorned, not supported, acknowledged or praised they are more likely to drop out, have pre-marital sex and become pregnant younger and achieve lower grades. Whilst boys didn't seem to be at all affected by these factors of the educational environment.

"I have a 3 year old son who is in preschool.  It is really interesting to note how different children play/ act/ socialize. Completely anecdotal, but through my observation of his peers in preschool the past two years, toddler girls in general seem to be a lot more socially in-tune with other children, adults and what's going on in the environment around them. Both Nature/ biology and nurture are a part of the picture, of course. But social conditioning of expected gender norms (nurture) seems to make a bigger difference as children age. If through both biology and culture, females are more social creatures, I can see social acceptance of peers and those they look up to (educators, parents, community leaders, etc), to play a great role in desire for education. _x0007__x0007_I don't think boys are free from the affects of social pressure though.  Certainly positive/ supportive vs. negative environments will make a difference with them as well.  Children of both genders drop out over bullying. Active/ spirited children who might thrive in a more open or progressive learning environment might be made to feel like they are bad children and constantly be disciplined for not sitting still and listening in a more regimented school structure. Being made to feel like a \bad boy\"" early on by teachers will no doubt affect how that child views school and learning in the long term.""",1,0,1

"I very much appreciate the attention given to statistics and data in Chapter 3 of \From Outrage to Courage\"" (Murray 2013). Murray reminds us that statistics often capture absolute levels of enrollment (Ibid.: 42); however, it is necessary to look at both enrollment and attendance to get the full picture (Ibid.: 43). The heavy reliance on enrollment as an indicator of girls' education is a lazy response to a complex issue._x0007__x0007_Lloyd and Young (2009) go a step further to address the need for improvement in data collection methods, especially regarding non-formal education. It is important to recognize that girls and women receive non-formal education through various channels and that these types of programs fill a critical need for girls and women unable to receive formal schooling for diverse reasons. Thus, it is necessary to also collect data on non-formal education to truly grasp the ways in which girls and women are being educated across the world. _x0007__x0007_I appreciate that both readings address quality of education.

At the beginning, the United States made extraordinary steps toward personal freedoms and rights.  Puritan ideas of being blessed by God made inconsonant means to these valued free ends become consonant.2   This is translated into our foreign policy: we have a national self-image that we are good and our enemies are evil.  In this perpetuation of a melodrama worldview, we have placed federal regulations on the types of violence from war we are allowed to view on television.  So, many of us aren’t even exposed to the types of issues that would show reason for CEDAW or the CRC.  Those who have seen such things, experience cognitive dissonance.

"There are several factors at play, but here are a couple to think about:_x0007__x0007_ 1. In those unequal environments, boys are the default. Boys are the default in most of the world. They are the ones expected to succeed in the classroom and out of it. Bottom line, boys are the ones expected to **BE** in the classroom. No one is surprised when a boy shows up to class. There are probably very few schools where girls are favored and boys ignored (though that would be an interesting case!). _x0007_ <zipRedac>. Girls are not the default. They haven't always been in school. Teachers can be unprepared and can hold the same patriarchal, sexist views that had kept girls out of the classroom. Not seeing other girls in the class can make a student feel alone and vulnerable. _x0007_ 3. Stereotype threat. This is a phenomenon in social psychology when a member of a group is at risk of believing a negative stereotype about their group. For example, let's say the world believed girls were not good at math. When a girl enters a difficult math class and she doesn't do as well as she hopes, she might believe that it is due to girls' inherent lack of math skills. While it is not conclusive that stereotype threat causes achievement gaps, stereotype threat could factor in to a girl's confidence in a learning environment that does not support her. _x0007_ 4.

"Thanks for the praise!  I’m glad you could appreciate these thoughts.  It sounded like we may have been going through the same process of breaking away from all of the statistical reasons to do right by the women and realizing that doing right is reason enough.  The ironic part is that we can only imagine the effects of valuing justice over development; I believe striving for true equality without any other expectations would produce astounding results.  As we talk about subordination of women, we should certainly acknowledge that when women are given their rights in effort to further other goals then they being used are tools and as long as that mindset exists there will never be true equality.  No one will deny that individual females are better off for being used to achieve development goals but women need not be the stepping stones.    _x0007__x0007_Earlier today I was trying to find analogies to compare the development approach’s use of women’s rights to other groups’ rights.  I thought, “Let’s say that blacks in the U.S. are women in this analogy and the U.S. needs to grow the economy.  Black students have lower test scores, graduation rates, etc and because studies show that our economic success directly correlates with our students’ educational success then we should focus on getting those black students educated.  It’s a win-win because the poor, black kids get the education and the country boasts improved economics.”  It sounds outrageous when we talk about treating racial minorities as pawns for a bigger purpose, to diminish each black student’s life to a statistic, to better their lives with ulterior motives.  Yet that is exactly what the current approach of global development does to women.  Right after this thought, I opened up to Anne’s book and found her similar thoughts in her paragraph on page 47 about transforming our societies.  “It is imperative that we make the concept of justice central.”   _x0007__x0007_I honestly cannot get over this concept and this conversation.

"I don't think so, Trlake. Whereas male circumcision has been proven to reduce some health risks in populations with scarce access to water and hygiene, female mutilations do not. Whereas male circumcision only acts on skin (and I have seen it performed in Africa, in a village CLINIC so in a bad enough situation, but not so bad, it's not painless and it's quite bloody, as far as it regards me it's already appalling), female mutilation is deprivation of a part of the body and bodily function. Whereas male circumcision is just ritual, female mutilation has the actual function to improve male pleasure while depriving the woman of it, or best, leaving her with pain. It has all to do with male (and social but in a male controlled society) control over woman, and nothing more. Something is left also in the West. At delivery, today, most women in the so called \first world\"" countries, will get a cut on their genitals at childbirth, usually only in the first (it marks a passage, doesn't it), in the distorted idea that this will avoid her tearing (or rather will avoid her tissues to stretch properly and leave her unharmed) and then it was in use to give her a good and tight \""marital stitch\"" so that she could be as tight as new... this has all to do with male control and male pleasure, and not with medical necessity.""",0,0,1

Educated women are more active economically, helping eradicate poverty. Educated women are marrying later, helping reduce child mortality. Educated women are having sex later, and in New Lessons, educated women are more likely to practice safer sex, thus combating HIV and AIDS.

For female cutting to be practiced as a \rite of passage\"" or safeguard for purity, for generations, makes change difficult to bring about. I thought it was interesting how in the reading (Ch. 3, Outrage to Courage) it was mentioned that the threat of being fined 40 camels was enough to stop some women from continuing their business of cutting young girls.

"One of the ideas i loved most from \New Lessons: the Power of Educating Adolescent Girls\"" is simply how a girl in a uniform; carrying her books, is viewed by society as sexually available, and might be often looked at with both fear and respect. And although the book pointed out many of the faults tainting most education systems in developing countries, like the relevance of curriculums to the girl's lives, and the gender prejudice that still many teachers maintain. The world is moving forward with many girls seeking education today more than ever. However i believe that  sexual education should also be implemented more strongly in schools, especially in countries where child marriages,and backwards practices like FMG are pervasive ._x0007_The social and economic impact of girl's education is great. However the fact that most organisations -even this chart- have to compromise addressing the basic right of education from a humane point of view, and instead talk about it in terms of economic and even social benefit is very sad.

"Goals 1 and 6 are imperative for girl's access to education. As we read in the readings this week, women drop out due to their basic needs not being met and the fact that girls are depended upon for their labor and other familial and community roles and skills. If girls do not have access to basic life sustaining needs (i.e. Goal 1: eradicate extreme poverty and hunger) and are highly susceptible to HIV via sexual abuse, human trafficking and female genital mutilation and cutting, or already infected with life threatening diseases  with a lack of access to healthcare, how can they have access to education (Goal 6)? It's not hard to see why education would be lower on the list of needs for these girls._x0007__x0007_In answer to the second question, I think that beyond basic needs being met, the underlying notion needs to be that girls and women are valuable and hold human worth which is encapsulated in Goal 3:promote gender equality and empower women.

"Certainly the setting of a refugee camp is unlikely to be conducive to gathering quality data.  I doubt that the data used in Cynthia's report includes data from displaced persons or refugee camps.

"Hi Anne,_x0007__x0007_Thanks for organizing this course it is very informative and eye opening. I'm originally from Kenya but I'm currently here in California. After reading the articles and listening to the interviews of how 'girls education' can fix things, I want to disagree with some issues. From my personal perspective, I went to high school and acquired some of my college education in Kenya, but not until I came to America that I believed in myself or could 'lift my face up', I learned how to talk.. it was like all over sudden finding a voice that was trembling with fear of uncertain, and so to cut the story short, I don't believe girls education in general will fix the problem we are facing in the developing countries. Girls and women in my country and others (developing) suffer from low self esteem, they do not know where they belong nor their potentials, they have no dream of their own. All we know and on their mind is marriage - one day they will find a husband, and they and family works towards that from the day you are born or after you show signs of maturity. Therefore, until education system is revised 'the UN goal' will be far reached. Moreso, the teachers teaching these girls themselves are from the generation that put down women/girls, or themselves suffer from low self esteem or are abused or are abusers. Who is helping who here? What is the true meaning of education? Could we probably have a lesson to teach girls to believe in themselves to boost self esteem or distract the society from the marriage set mind? Could we first of all educate these teachers on self esteem before they can educate? Are we missing something.. While I strongly believe education is an asset lets work on a realistic goal instead of singing the same song 100 years to come. With all the time 'UN' and other none profit organization spends in developing countries if they looked in simple issues that they tend to ignore I strongly believe there would have had a big impact, but decisions are made by people who are 50 years ahead of those that need help, thus make decisions based on what they know which most cases do not make sense to those that applies but they go along because of money...well.

"From my own perspective, if someone doesn't see something as being wrong, there is no way they will welcome change. If the women here  don't see anything wrong in sexual abuse, which is what it is, then chances are there is nothing any international organization or advocacy group can do to make things better. I strongly believe in the shift of mindset through education for the women. In some parts of Africa, many of us women have been thought to see our worth through the eyes of a man. In Nigeria, there is this crazy need to be married by young women, regardless of what the man is about. This marriage frenzy is what has kept many women in abusive relationships simply because they want to be called Mrs. I strongly think that if the mindset of women is worked on, they will then decide for themselves whether a situation is right or wrong, and make more informed decisions simply because they have been empowered. Culture is huge and is integral but we can't tell people their culture is wrong because they will instantly resent you. But we should be looking at empowering women especially in a shift of mindset while respecting their culture. That woman will then be empowered to know that it's best to walk out of an abusive marriage and be alone, than be in it and die either through domestic violence or sexual abuse that may lead to her contracting HIV. Does that mean that her culture won't frown at her decision? Of course they will. But because she is empowered to see herself more than a piece of cloth to be toyed with, it will be easier for her to make informed decisions.",1,1,1

"All the readings were interesting in high lightening the transformative role of educating women in development, not only as a right we all should be entitled, but also the reasons why investing in girls is smart economics. Despite this course seeks to address women´s needs as an undeniable right that should be met in light of justice, my experience advocating for women´s equality, has proven that sometimes, economic arguments result in a more willing participation in changing women´s lives, rather than justice. Sad as it may be, advocacy among certain groups cannot be achieved easily without appealing to the economic benefits of equality. _x0007_In regards to the themes address in all lectures, I kept feeling some things were missing in the issues that prevent women from accessing school, issues that not necessarily are only women´s issues, but that once added to being a girl add a third or fourth axis of discrimination. Race; for example in some countries play a fundamental role in women´s dropping school, or being left behind. Disabilities are also something that needs to be looked upon and addressed in order to ensure women enroll and keep studying. Not only physical or mental disabilities, but learning disabilities,  children with sight problems, dyslexia and dyspraxia, for example, are left behind in their groups making them feel unsecure or thick, as a woman I know put it about her own experience. Lack of screening methods for learning problems and additional support in education need to be embedded to ensure they not only enroll and continue, but are capable of making the most of it._x0007_In the ICRW report and somehow in new Lesson,  he readings touch on the importance of the quality in education, to look deep at the curricula to ensure girls are being represented in a positive light. In the same line I suggest, that ethnicity representation, disabilities, nationalities, class and any other themes that intersect with the identity of girls (and boys as well) need to be included in a positive light. On top of gender, we need to tackle other ideas that might affect migrant population, descendants of migrants or groups that are systematically discriminated against. In US and UK for example, people of color are systematically oppressed despite great achievements so far.

We have learned through the readings that, while there is also a strong economic incentive for educating girls, this immediate economic consequences for families in terms of lost labor or school fees, often take priority on the level of individual families and communities. You point out, however, that there is also much more to educating girls than economics, otherwise there would be no reason for killing the father of a girl who went against cultural norms to fight for an education.  There would be no reason for little girls like Malala to be shot for daring to pursue an education.  There must also be a strong fear of the capabilities of girls and women.  Otherwise why would there be so many obstacles purposefully aimed to keep girls from accessing equal education to boys. We really haven't touched on this in the course yet, but I remember one of my college anthropology courses touched on the idea that keeping children from accessing education prevents them from learning to think critically and keeps them from pushing for social change. The example I remember was The Lord's Resistance Army in the DRC, and how these children were used because they were uneducated, lacked a sense of belonging to their community, and were easily brainwashed into ruthlessly complying with orders from military leaders.  They lacked the capacity to resist their superiors and were very easy to manipulate into embracing their new roles in the army. While this example is not directly applicable to reason why girls are limited and denied education, it does suggest that a contributing factor could be the desire of male elders in the community to control and limit the social clout of women.",0,0,1
"There are many goodwills all around the world who believe in the education of girls and incorporating women into the work force. But in reality, these results are not achieved. I think governments should provide incentives to encourage these girls to go to school. Encourage women to enter vocational trainings and we will begin to see higher and better results",1,0,1
"I've have seen several documentaries on this subject. However, after reading this chapter, I felt like I was in the room with each woman and her daughters. It upsets me that not everyone looks at girls in a positive way; that idea that women should be house slaves. I couldn't imagine living on less than a $1 a day. I can barely survive on $10. I also think that  we need to really look at Chile's practices. Lets apply their ses management skills to other disadvantage countries.",0,0,1
"In Senegal Italian development cooperation has financed a project on girls' education focusing on primary school. It provided scholarship for girls, psychological and pedagogic assistance, mentoring, training for teachers and curricula revision as well as all the other key points in order to promote girls education such as communication and awareness campaigns with communities, parents, religious leaders, teachers and so on. Moreover, in order to make activities sustainable, the project promoted economic activities for the mothers’ organisations, working within the schools, providing services for students at low cost (uniforms, meals, etc.)._x0007_This approach has been recognised by the Senegalese Ministry of education and cited in the new sectorial programme for education as a best practice in order to enhance its  gender policy. As a consequence, Italian cooperation has decided to finance another phase of the same programme. This phase will put the focus on secondary education and all the aspects relating to reproductive health as well as women rights as human rights. The programme will also give an important place to women alphabetisation, giving a second chance to young women who dropped out.",1,0,1

After this, the law changed and stated that rape was a crime against the person, the individual person. I don't actually know if the punishment changed accordingly or became more serious or anything, I guess it did, anyway. But to me, personally it makes a huge difference knowing that my country believes that raping me is a problem of public morality, or that raping me is a crime against me. It means that to my country I am worth something and that what I feel is worth something, and not that it is \""inappropriate\"" towards the society raping me.

This MDG is far from being realised and will stand no hope with education of women.  The children of educated mothers are much more likely to be immunized against killer diseases, their mothers are much more likely to have received antenatal care, and they provide better nutrition to their children.

"But all too often HIV-positive people become targets of AIDS discrimination and stigma. On top of handling new health challenges, they sometimes face rejection by family and friends. They may be forced out of homes, lose jobs, or even become victims of violence. Unfortunately, AIDS discrimination and stigma also fuel the epidemic. They prevent people from talking about their HIV status with sex partners or people with whom they share needles. Fear of rejection and worries about confidentiality also prevent many from getting tested for HIV. This means they may spread HIV to others without knowing it.Many factors can lead to AIDS discrimination and stigma: HIV is a deadly disease that many people fear. Some adults still wrongly believe that they can catch HIV through casual contact, such as sharing a drinking glass or touching a toilet seat. This greatly increases their fear about being near people who are infected. Many people connect HIV and AIDS with behaviors that are already stigmatized, such as sex between men or injecting drugs.

In developing countries, where young and adolescent girls do not fully attend formal or state-run schools, non-formal schools or education facilities have emerged.  These non-formal schools are run by NGOs, donors or local communities to provide children and adolescents access to an education that they may not otherwise have.  _x0007__x0007_I was lucky enough to volunteer at an NGO-run non-formal school in Udaipur, India. The school was directed towards gypsy children whose families often moved or who could not afford to have children leave for a majority of the day to attend state-run schools.  Although state-run primary education in India is free, poor families often require their children, especially girls, to stay home and work instead of getting an education.  Non-formal schools offer the opportunity for these children to attend school because they are often run at hours that can accommodate the children’s work day.  The school I volunteered at ran from 2pm-5pm.  Attendance was taken everyday and children were encouraged to attend daily through incentives such as a daily healthy meal and through threat of not being allowed back if they missed more than a week of school.   I noticed that there were more girls than boys between the ages of 5-8, however it was extremely evident that more boys aged 9-13 attended than girls.  _x0007__x0007_Non-formal education facilities, such as this school in Udaipur, are important for children who cannot access state-run schools.  However, these facilities also require the attention of the global community in order to encourage and facilitate the attendance of adolescent girls.  Through offering schooling at different times throughout the day and accommodating to the needs of these girls, improved access to education could be achieved.  I agree with Lloyd in her suggestion that surveys be conducted on attendance in non-formal schools as well as in her suggestion that the non-formal sector and formal sector should be well integrated.  Through the help of donors and volunteers,  the non-formal sector could enable young and adolescent girls to attend formal secondary and post-secondary institutions.",1,0,1
"I have looked at a few of the infographics on the Education For All website and, although I commemorate them for in their efforts to spread the message of girls education, I have noticed that they are doing it more so through a \development\"" based argument versus the argument that education and gender equality are basic human rights.  Professor Murray has made this argument in her research and I agree with her that we should be focusing on educating girls because it is a human right, not because it will help with worldwide economic development.  _x0007__x0007_It is sad that the message on educating girls has to be spread using economic arguments instead of valuing them for their social and human impact.  I have seen similar arguments be made in environmental campaigns, where economic arguments are placed above social impacts.  Although these arguments may be more effective in our current social atmosphere, I believe it is extremely important to educate the global community on the danger of assigning an economic value to social development.  Educating girls and women and achieving gender equality will have many more positive impacts on society than simply just short-run economic gains.""",0,0,1
"I have seen these statistics before. I believe they can be a useful tool to persuade governments to promote and make education for girls accessible. However, my experience and studies have showed me that these statistics don't do much more than just show in numbers what education for girls can do economically.

"Agreed. As the 'son preference' content of Class 2 makes clear, there are some forms/manifestations of sexism that can only be addressed by changing the way girls' fundamental value as human beings is perceived, and that can only come about by looking at issues like education as matters of human rights.",1,0,1
"I have a hard time wrapping mind around these MDGs, mostly because they seem to be based heavily on theory and not so much practice. However this is probably matter for another discussion. What is of concern here is what role does the education of girls plays in the fulfillment of these goals. Given what we know from the readings the goals that most directly relate to girls' education are goals 2, 4 and 5. Girls' education is key if we want to achieve universal primary education. Reducing child mortality and improving maternal health can be achieved by educating girls, according to Summers from the World Bank, it takes just 5 years of education to save a life of a child in Africa. As far as all the rest of the goals, I don't think they relate directly to girls' education, although they may indirectly. Goal 1 for example can relate directly to girls' education but not enough to garner significant change. I think that may have to do with the fact that there are countries that have high rates of poverty and girls are educated. I believe there are other factors that create and perpetuate poverty and hunger. Same goes for the spread of HIV/AIDS etc, ensuring environmental sustainability and developing a partnership for development. Goal 3 is another goal that is directly related to girls' education, and I think it is as obvious as goal 2. _x0007__x0007_Now, which goals are dependent on girls' education I think only goal 2 and 3. The rest depend significantly on other factors that I think go far beyond simply educating girls. I honestly think its more about educating our 'leaders' to change their priorities, stop corruption, stop giant corporations from exploiting the poor, stop the fighting and the violence, etc. I am very weary and skeptical of these goals because statistics do not always tell us the whole story, and they are easily manipulated. Although, I do not doubt that there has been progress made since the goals were created, but I think it naive to believe that we can completely eradicate poverty and hunger.",1,0,1

"In developing countries, I would like to see more teacher training/health and nutrition training/ doula or midwife training and general medical/dental education target for young women specifically so that they have a needed career for the care of their children which gives them self respect and a respected place in their community.  I also feel that general education for both males and females should encompass basic reading, writing and math, caring for household finances and sex/relationship education including the need to eradicate violence in familial relationships and the frightful rise in STD's and HIV/AIDS.  We could also use these things in developed countries in the areas of ignorance and poverty.",1,0,1

"There seems to be a consensus among many of the posts that goals 2 and 3 related directly to girls' education. That is my opinion as well. Goals 1, 4-8 are more a product that comes from education in general. It would be naive, however, to think that any of the goals could be reached 100% without proper, quality education for half the world's population. I think the goals are appropriate for the entire world because they are intended to raise the quality of life of everyone, but are not necessarily geared toward creating a non-diverse world. I hope that I am not missing something when I say that the goals aren't enforcing a western telos._x0007__x0007_For the readings on education, I found Ch. 3 of “From Outrage to Courage” much more digestible than “New Lessons: The Power of Educating Adolescent Girls”. The two readings are not really comparable because one is an extensive research of who is doing what, and the other is a very good overview of what and why. Two sides of the same coin. What stood out for me was the missing data of non-formal education. I think it would be well worth it to try to uncover that data, although, I am sure it would take a significant amount of digging. _x0007_	_x0007_My biggest concern related to goals for education is that the specific cultural content is not lost to Western ideologies. I think it is incredibly important that children at least begin their studies in their native language. I think it would be harder for them to think of education as a normal thing for their communities if the very language is different from everyday life. I hope that every child will soon have the opportunity to receive an education, but I also hope that the providers of the education are conscious of the local life (which the Lloyd report illustrates as a key to getting and retaining girls in schools).",1,0,1

"I was fascinated by the breadth of work that Dr. Richardson has taken on to address questions of public health.  I found that I share his perspective that the biomedical lens dominating the landscape and often \sucks the air out\"", leaving no space for other approaches.  Thinking back to the \""Women, Poverty and Aids\"" reading, there certainly can be a number of social interventions targeting women that can help combat epidemics, including access to safe homes and child care, access to secondary education and real training and access to employment opportunities._x0007_  In the first case, women in poverty struggle to serve themselves and their families. Unable to break out of the cycle of poverty, many turn to the dangerous alternatives of drugs and/or prostitution to attempt to make ends meet, and can lose the ability to care for children. Providing access to free or affordable, safe childcare can help a woman feel secure that her children are safe while she can focus on finding or keeping a job and make it less likely that she and her children will be exposed to HIV infection._x0007_  Similarly, increasing access and lowering barriers to secondary education and employment training to young women, make it easier for them to seek their own path and avoid early marriage, early child-bearing, or fall victim to poor conditions of health and housing. These forces set the stage for a stronger prevalence of HIV and other epidemics than their more educated counterparts.  I fully support Dr. Richardson's efforts to show how these examples of structural violence can be indicators and in some cases determinants of the prevalence of diseases like HIV. I commend his multi-disciplinary approach, and the desire to apply his academic research toward real policy outcomes.""",1,0,1

"Over the past few years I have found myself doing quite a bit of reading and research around the practice of FGM/cutting and it never ceases to sadden me to the point of tears. The fact that women perpetrate this against girls - usually their own children is awful, but not the most unbelievable part of the practice I have found.

That was until I was alerted to another horrific practice, found in Cameroon and neighbouring countries that echoes that of FGM - Breast Ironing, or BI. This was discovered accidentally in 2005 by a German organisation who were surveying Cameroonian groups in regards to rape, incest and other forms of sexual violence. It involves the pummelling of a pre-pubescent girls chest with hard, hot implements such as hot flat stones, pestles, hammers and the like to stop the budding of a girls mammary glands. Aside from the obvious pain this causes, the long term affects are just as awful and far reaching, sometimes affecting the next generation of children as a girl who has been subjected to BI may find her milk production later in life is adversely affected.

"Millennium Development Goals 1 and 3 relate directly to girls’ education. Educating girls will have direct positive effects through increasing literacy levels, creating opportunities for women to enter the workplace and for them to earn an income. Educating girls will also have wider implications that can impact on all areas of development. If women are able to generate an income this will impact MDG 1 by ensuring her and her family are able to sustain a livelihood, lift themselves out of poverty and stay above the poverty line. _x0007__x0007_The extract from Lawrence Summers, the World Bank’s chief economist, states that “educating women reduces child mortality.” Educated women will have an increased understanding of good health and sanitation practices, available medical care and avenues to access it. They are also more likely to seek medical help. These will have impacts on MGDs 4 and 5. Educated women will generally have less children which means more resources and food can be distributed per child, resulting in healthier children and mothers: a contributing factor in the reduction of child and maternal mortality. Knowledge is key in reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS. If women are educated they are more likely to: confront and discuss taboos surrounding sex and sexually transmitted diseases; be aware of the risks; and take preventative measures. The more educated society becomes, the less stigma will be attached to HIV and this will increase the number of people that seek help. Goal 7 is particularly interesting regarding the wider effects of educating girls. Education will ensure that women learn about environmental sustainability, its benefits and alternative resources available. To achieve Goal 8, it is essential to educate girls and continue working to achieve equality for women: it is not possible to have a global partnership for development if over half the world (ie women and girls) are not represented. _x0007__x0007_We have been learning throughout this section of the course that educating girls is a right and education should be available to girls because it is the ‘just’ thing to do.

Hersi was comparing the two dismissed deputy speakers to the two wives and comparing himself to the lion man. After more loud cheers Hersi concluded: “We shall see who coughs up goats milk.” The Minister’s reference to “coughing up goat’s milk” is a common way of issuing a threat, and adds to the many threatening phrases used against women and children in a conflict region where the risk of sexual attacks and violence is high._x0007__x0007_The statistics on violence against women and children in Somaliland are disturbing.

It's really great to see someone from a \technical\"" background take on this other way of approaching issues such as gender inequality and it's affect on HIV/AIDS. _x0007__x0007_Here are my three suggestions regarding social/non-medical interventions to help prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS: _x0007__x0007_1. **Fun, Informative and Relevant Sexual Education for girls and boys**. This would start in primary school and continue up until they finish school. According to Murray, and other readings for this course, education is key. However, as part of empowering girls and boys, young women and men, they need to know more than just the anatomy and basic knowledge of how reproduction works. Sexual education needs to be informative and give the correct information, regarding disease, reproduction, menstruation etc. It also needs to be relevant to the age of the students. Finally, it needs to be fun! It needs to be creative, so that the message really gets through and students can live the lessons they learn. This can be done with value based exercises, group projects like setting up a play, or doing a video project, or a poster. _x0007__x0007_Beyond teaching students about std's, reproduction and anatomy, they also need to be taught the importance of being self aware of their boundaries when it comes to their integrity. They need to know how to say No, stand for that No, and how to respect that No. They also need to know who to turn to in case they are being harassed. This class should also deal with peer pressure and how one stands up to that. Another issue would be to address the issue of how to have a dialogue with their partner regarding sex “how does this feel for you?” “do you like it like this?” as well as discussing the responsibility of not pushing their will onto someone else. Perhaps this can be done on a regular basis and girls and boys can divide up so that girls will speak with a female teacher and boys with a male teacher, and that they sometimes have sessions together.  Here they could also practice putting on a condom on a dummy penis and learn about other contraceptives. They could role play. They could also practice talking to one’s parents about issues regarding sexuality or love. There would also have to be time for questions from the students themselves. There could also be some sort of mentorship program, so that older students lead sessions with younger students. This could als""",1,0,1

It made me really sad that she may only have one child, and being a woman who seemed like she would have raised a girl in a good way, she instead is contributing to the ratio of more boys than girls in China.

"Social/non-medical interventions that might be effective in preventing or treating HIV/AIDS: _x0007__x0007_Education: Including sexual education with a component on HIV/AIDS into school programs would be a first step to prevent the pandemic. However, as we have seen in Chapter 2, many children and particularly girls, do not have access to formal schooling. Therefore, non-formal educational programs should also tackle the issue. Education through the creation of health education programs and outreach centers for teenagers could also contribute to a prevention strategy. Educating women and girls is particularly crucial in order to place them in a position to educate their children and communities. Women educated on the topic will be less likely to transmit the virus to their babies or will be aware of the medical treatments available to both of them. _x0007__x0007_Access to economical resources: Women often turn to drugs and prostitution because of a lack of better alternative. In addition to the stigma associated with those activities, those women are at greater risk of contracting the virus. Creation of other income-generating activities for women can increase their choice and allow them to earn their living through safer means. Access to economical resources is also fundamental for all women in order to be able to negotiate safe sexual intercourse through the use of condoms as well as access health care if required. Governments could develop programs to encourage either women’s employment through the creation of jobs or women’s entrepreneurial activities through facilitated access to micro-loans.   _x0007__x0007_Legal framework: _x0007__x0007_As mentioned in Chapter 4 of Anne Firth Murray’s book, ‘in Eastern and Southern Africa, the main risk factor for women contracting HIV is being married’ and there is a similar trend in Asia. It seems that looking at this in order to identify a non-medical intervention would be helpful. One could think about laws criminalising the purposeful transmission of the HIV/AIDS: if a husband has unprotected sex outside marriage, contracts the virus and then has unprotected sex with his wife, he might be found criminally responsible of transmitting the virus. But the requisite intentional element might be difficult to prove, especially in light of the fact that men do not necessarily know about HIV/AIDS and how it is transmitted. They might not even know that they are infected. _x0007__x0007_Another legal approach could be forbidding early marriages. This might give an incentive for gi",1,0,1

This causes more men to enter professions traditionally considered to be more valuable. While getting girls into education is of course the first step, once girls are in schools they should be motivated by peers and teachers to pursue the same subjects boys pursue and vice versa.

Recognizing this as the growing trend/ current situation in many developing/ under-developed countries is of great importance and paints a better picture of the education of youth and young people.

"The goals that relate directly to girls education are Goal 2 (universal primary education) and Goal 3 (gender equality and promoting empowerment through reducing gender disparity in the education). The previous readings (Chapter 3 in From Outrage to Courage and Chapters 1-3 in New Lessons) point to progress in this area with a number of countries moving towards free education being available at the Primary level. What is of interest to note is that this is also being made a reality in the development arena by the enforcement by lending agencies as part of the criteria for receiving developmental loans.  Forced or encouraged the goal of universal primary education is on the increase. Also with the introduction of feeding programs within schools (as was mentioned in previous readings) the goals directly related to girls education is being realized with the added incentive which promotes enrollment and possibly sustains attendance. With the growth of non-formal schooling, these goals have also being realized, however the challenge is documenting this hidden population and understanding its reach and impact on educating girls. _x0007__x0007_The remaining goals 1 and 4-8 i would argue are dependent on educating girls for their fulfillment.

Educated females have children at a later age, are more knowledgeable and more able and willing to do what is necessary for the health of the child. The data also suggested that when female are educated maternal mortality is reduced and there is a more successful fight against diseases, again through education and empowerment. Some of these were stated in the World Bank report by chief economist Lawrence Summers (although some of his arguments were questionable (more education= More marriage= less AIDS is not supported by the data coming out of East Africa which indicates that being married was a major risk factor for women contracting HIV)_x0007__x0007_Education of a population and more specifically education of females will eventually allow for and lead to environmental sustainability.

"The series of videos featuring Dr. Gene Richardson certainly provided a lot of food for thought. As someone who was an anthropology major but with experience in biomedical sexual and reproductive health, I found his insight particularly interesting and relevant to discussions surrounding structural violence and how that then plays out in public health._x0007__x0007_Here are my ideas for interventions:_x0007__x0007_1) Peer Education_x0007__x0007_When I interned with UNFPA in Costa Rica, one program they had in place was the training of peer educators in rural, northern areas where many Nicaraguan immigrants reside. This is a population that faces discrimination, and so they are that much more at risk for HIV infection. The program focused on teenagers, since as we all know, young women are contracting HIV at a very rapid rate. I saw how these teens, armed with knowledge but also an innate understanding of how their communities functioned, went around spreading information and providing opportunities to discuss these important matters. These peer educators received a boost of self esteem by being the ones to help their friends. The families were also very proud, as I personally saw when I got to know one young woman who was an educator in her town. This also relates back to empowering women, and especially younger ones._x0007__x0007_2) Another related line of intervention is to provide spaces to explore structural inequalities in places where this is not often done. I grew up in a place where we did talk about sexism and such, but I know that this is not the norm for everyone. In one workshop we completed in Costa Rica, we looked at body image with young women and discussed messages we received from the media, our families, etc. and then translated those messages to how we felt and behaved. This wasn't a line of thinking that this particular group was accustomed to, but they were very engaged and interested in debating it amongst themselves. Sometimes a spark will take hold enough to create small changes that can then grown into larger ones._x0007__x0007_3) Micro-loan sites like Kiva may be a slightly more indirect way of addressing the problem. When women are economically dependent on men, they are in a difficult position where they are unable to fully be in control of themselves and their bodies. If the choice is risk HIV infection or be thrown out or abandoned, many are going to take the risk simply to survive in the present. Like education, investing in women's businesses and providing opportunities in which they",1,0,1

"The issue of HIV/AIDS prevention is very complex not only because of the illness itself but because of the varied contexts it exists and spreads. Prevention strategies need to be tailored to the community and the culture of the people they target. Secondly I strongly believe that men need to be involved into and any prevention strategies that are developed and implemented. Considering that HIV/AIDS thrives in places where there are large disparities in gender equality, targeting prevention activities only to the most powerless will have little effect. Thus my proposed prevention strategies are as follows:_x0007__x0007_1.)	Target men with education on HIV/AIDS, the spread of the virus and what role men play in the spread of the disease. The campaigns need to be led by males, local community leaders and other male champions of the cause. The campaign also needs to bring the problem of HIV/AIDS into men’s circle of interest – that is it needs to show men what is in it for them to take action to prevent spread of HIV? How will they benefit from using a condom for example.  Taking up some marketing principles, the bottom line is always about cost-benefit._x0007__x0007_2.)	Provision of free condoms coupled with an advertising/marketing campaign to encourage uptake of condom use among men, and make it easier for women to negotiate condom use. In a society where women are seen as possessions and are powerless, there is no incentive for men to change their behaviour to protect women, and encouraging women to negotiate condom use will continue to be unsuccessful because of their lower status in society. Campaigns to make male condom use seen as ‘cool’ or ‘popular’ coupled with the availability of free condoms could impact on the spread of HIV/AIDS, particularly among the poorest and most vulnerable._x0007__x0007_3.)	Provision of free schooling for both girls and boys up to high-school level coupled with incentives to keep children, particularly female children in school. For example through the provision of free lunch and financial incentives to keep older girls in school. Such steps could be seen as the government or the community valuing girls and their education and it will increase the value of a girl as well as provider her with education which can have flow on effects to the rest of her life and the community.",1,0,1

"I worked in a midwifery program in Australia a while back. The state health system was trying to address and deal with domestic violence, knowing the serious impact it has on the unborn child, the mother, family and community. All midwives, child health nurses and other professionals were given a thorough workshop before starting to use a Domestic Violence tool, which was designed to a identify domestic violence on first contact to teh health service. So at the first antenatal visit the woman is asked four easy questions as well as given a short information session about the impact of DV. AS a manager I often did chart audits, and often found these forms were not filled in. EVen after many antenatal visits these forms were often not filled in.DV being such a hidden subject, we are still not taking it in as part of the whole person, forms are not being filled in not only by the antenatal midwives, but also by other health professionals who attend woman at some stage in their pregnancy and postnatal period.  I spoke to the midwives and they all said that they felt embarrassed and that they felt it was too confronting. They were concerned that women would not come back to the service, and that they had to develop a close relationship before they could ask the questions. They did however, feel comfortable to discuss vaginal discharges, bowel habits,drug use, diet etc. When there was a death of a young mother from out of control domestic violence in our area, her chart showed she was not asked the questions after receiving full antenatal and postnatal care at the service. I did not see any improvement with the forms being filled out after this incident. More inservice was done to address the issue, with some temporary improvement. So if midwives can't address DV and change with knowledge and regulation..how must a young woman in a power over relationship feel.",0,0,1

"When I first heard the term structural violence I had to stop up and ponder a bit. \Violence\"" was maybe not the direct word I would use but then I started digging a bit. I'll post what I found because it made me understand the terminology a lot better._x0007__x0007_ It refers to a form of violence where some social structure or social institution may harm people by preventing them from meeting their basic needs. Institutionalized elitism, ethnocentrism, classism, racism, sexism, adultism, nationalism, heterosexism and ageism are some examples of structural violence as proposed by Galtung ( Johan Galtung, the inventor of this terminology). According to Galtung, rather than conveying a physical image, structural violence is an \""avoidable impairment of fundamental human needs\"". As it is avoidable, structural violence is a high cause of premature death and unnecessary disability. Since structural violence affects people differently in various social structures, it is very closely linked to social injustice. Structural violence and direct violence are said to be highly interdependent, including family violence, racial violence, hate crimes, terrorism, genocide, and war._x0007__x0007_In his book Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic, James Gilligan defines structural violence as \""the increased rates of death and disability suffered by those who occupy the bottom rungs of society, as contrasted with the relatively lower death rates experienced by those who are above them.\"" Gilligan largely describes these \""excess deaths\"" as \""non-natural\"" and attributes them to the stress, shame, discrimination and denigration that results from lower status_x0007__x0007_The violence in structural violence is attributed to the specific organizations of society that injure or harm individuals or masses of individuals.

I am in agreement with the statement that the U.S. doesn't want to surrender its sovereignty of laws to the international system. However, I find it simultaneously both totally ridiculous and somewhat believable that part of the reason the U.S. hasn't ratified CEDAW is an old-fashioned view of family values and the ongoing dialogue in this country about abortion. While I can see how some people would believe CEDAW is pro-abortion, I'm not sure that in 1980 America was in the same place in the national discussion about abortion as it is now.

"For my second written comment on the unit of HIV/AIDS I’ve found several points in the two readings,” Women, poverty and AIDS” and “Women are not just transmitters” that collide into the same pattern.

It is the female prostitute that gives you the sickness but who gave it to her and do we even care? Because of the low status of prostitutes it is ok to point fingers and blame them for the transmission of the disease. I find it eye opening that nobody stops to think about the customers just for once. It is not even seen as a risk group. Is it because they are men from all different parts of the society and hard to categorize or is it just easier to blame it on more marginalized group as prostitutes. And even the fact of them being prostitutes is their fault. “They chose it” or “they could have got a job”. All bad choices mad from a “bad” girl. I like how it is put in ” Women, poverty and AIDS” p.33 , that for women who are most at risk, life choices are limited! On p.32 we read of the three curses that are upon these women; objectification, institutionalized powerlessness and blame for their condition. This low self- esteem and powerlessness of their situation led many woman to be in the risk group of HIV/AIDS.

"The readings on HIV/AIDS are timely for me.  I’m traveling in March to Ethiopia to visit refugee camps and will be learning specifically about programs that serve adolescent girls. In preparation for the trip I came across a study that was done in rural Ethiopia (in the Amhara region) that involved in-depth interviews and a survey of 1,000 young people aged 10-19.  There were a few questions aimed to measure the respondents’ understanding of HIV/AIDS, particularly their exposure to messages conveyed through lectures in and out of school, dramas, and radio messages.

There are deeper roots to the AIDS endemic, rather than what most biomedical doctors, and medical practitioners will often see. Thus AIDS -in a great percent- is an outcome of a deeper problem; which is known as structural violence.

"Women’s International Health and Human Rights-_x0007__x0007_Question- Which goals relate directly to girls’ education?_x0007_It seems all of the goals relate to girls’ education, but the goals that are directly related seem to be goals 1-6.  These goals clearly have a direct cause and effect relationship with girls’ education.  In relation to goal one, poverty is less likely to occur if a girl is educated.  In a two working parent household, an income is welcome.  In a single parent household, which often consists of the mother, an income is lifesaving.  Education provides opportunities for employment.  At a minimum, literacy and math enable a women to sell products and generate a small business.  _x0007_Goals two and three are clearly directly related. Goal four, childhood mortality, reminds me of the statistic from last week in which we read that if a mother is literate, her child has 50% more of a chance to live past the age of five.  Amazing as this statistic is, it goes to show how empowering literacy is that it not only affects the women’s health, but also the health and wellbeing of her children.  _x0007_To this same end, goal five, maternal mortality, also directly connects a female’s education level with the likelihood of living through child birth.  We read this week that the most common reason women die giving birth is through unsafe abortion practices.  If a girl is educated, on sex or just in general, they are more likely to “make responsible choices”, use contraception, speak up for their rights, and understand their options. (Page 82 of Outrage to Courage). Additionally, ensuring clean birthing practices are susceptible to outdated social customs and dirty medical tools. The more educated a girl is, the more she will understand or be able to read about the needs associated with a clean and healthy birth. Again, this same idea applies to goal six- HIV.  The more a girl is educated, the less she will believe unsafe practices, the more she will be able to demand her rights or find resources to avoid unhealthy activity.  This directly relates to AIDs.  On page 92 of Outrage to Courage, Anne wrote that education and economics are directly related to HIV.  But beyond these imperative solutions, we must change the gender roles in society.

"This week’s readings set the scene of an alarming inequality between male and female education in developing countries, while introducing the idea that the education of females is one of the most powerful global interventions for improving international social and economic status.  It is also a means to reduce the disproportionate gender disparity that exists._x0007_From my personal perspective as an undergraduate medical student who was fortunate to have had attended private primary and secondary schools, I have always considered education the greatest inheritance and investment in my future. However, that children in developing countries, in particular females, are, for the most part, uneducated and illiterate I found alarming and disturbing._x0007_Statistics from UNICEF suggest that the implementation of free schooling and the provision of meals to children while they are at school resulted in a dramatic increase in enrolment from the years 2003–2006. In some countries female enrolment increased to 87% in primary school and 77% in secondary school. Albeit these statistics are somewhat misleading. That is, enrolment doesn’t translate to attendance. Nor does attendance ensure a quality curriculum, sound learning outcomes, or ensure completion of education. Nor do the available statistics provide official numbers for any of these different factors. So, I felt I was being misled slightly about what might be the true picture of education in these countries. _x0007_In her interview, Lynn Murphy introduced some of the problems that governments are trying to overcome when attempting to redo educational curriculum in developing countries that result in true learning, and some of the proposed policies. Yet, the large disconnect between government policy and what occurs in practice is vast, and it is clear that there needs to be alternative strategies for change.

"Gene Richardson’s extensive research into social interventions has been excellent food for thought in terms of focusing on structural interventions as opposed to the commonly used biomedical interventions for treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS.  Shifting from the medical lens that is so often used to view these problems, to the alternate lens of social means based on data analysis of widely available statistics from the United Nations Development Program, provided insights into ways to arm ourselves against the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

This can only be done through further education that teaches about the reality of HIV/AIDS (e.g. that it is not just limited to gay men, drug-users, sex workers and other groups that ore often discriminated against and ostracised from society and that men, as well as women, are transmitters- indeed more so, etc.) so that people no longer blame women and other groups for their contraction of the disease.

Girls and women should have access to free counselling, medical and legal services if they have been subjected to violence and official complaints bodies should be established for teachers, public officials and other such institutional figures, which include investigatory and punitive functions, so that a clear message is sent that violence against women will not be tolerated.  Most importantly, this should be coupled with education to all citizens that gender based violence is illegal and immoral so that new generations of boys grow up eschewing the violent practices and attitudes of their fathers towards women and so that girls have the voice and agency to challenge gender-discriminatory attitudes and practices and to assume decision-making positions in all sectors.",1,0,1

"From the various discussions in this course, I feel strongly that education--particularly of woman and girls--is perhaps the number one thing we can do to work towards health and justice on a global and local scale. Gene Richardson's talk suggests a more holistic approach to combating AIDS, and I will share some social/non-medical ways that AIDS can be prevented through education and community intervention._x0007__x0007_As has been discussed, sex-education that is appropriate to the culture and the ages being addressed can greatly deter the spread of AIDS. I would suggest that such education could be more holistic by teaching young people to evaluate their feelings before entering a relationship, to value themselves and others as a person and understand mutual consent and respect saying no, and to combat the stigma of AIDS by inviting people infected with HIV and AIDS to share their stories._x0007__x0007_In addition to sex-education, easily accessible primary and secondary education, and life-skills classes should be readily available to give young women the opportunity to live independently and not have to marry young or put themselves in risky situations. These kinds of classes and workshops can take on many forms. In college, I took a one-credit class on self-defense against sexual assault. Before learning and practicing techniques for warding off a physical attack, we spent the majority of class time discussing consent, the prevalence of date rape or sexual assault from an acquaintance, and affirming the value of saying no and walking away. If more female youth could have these conversations, even at a younger age, I believe they would be much more empowered to protect themselves. Sometimes the most essential thing is starting a single conversation._x0007__x0007_Gene Richardson suggests that it's as simple as the way we treat our young girls that can effect whether or not they get an infection years down the road. This made me think of how many girls feel they are of little value based on their position in society, or even and especially in their family. What if families and communities gathered to specifically celebrate the girl child and actively acknowledged her worth and value as a human being? A friend of mine works for an NGO called Kites Global, which is currently focused in India. Among the many things they do in educating children and caregivers, one event they hosted that caught my eye was celebrating the International Day of the Girl Child, celebrates childhood and speaks out ",1,1,1
"Drawing from our previous lessons, I believe education is an incredibly effective social intervention.  Mr. Richardson brought up so many good points in regards to the authority of the science world and the decision makers only seeing issues through a certain lens.

"Which goals relate directly to girls' education? _x0007__x0007_(1) Achieving universal primary education and (2) promoting gender equality and empowering women are both directly related to the education of girls. The second of these two additionally states the goal to \eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education preferably by 2005, and in all levels of education no later than 2015.\"" Thus, the education of girls, specifically, is central to each of these goals. _x0007__x0007_Which goals are dependent on educating girls for their fulfillment? _x0007__x0007_One could argue that every single goal would be positively impacted by educating girls. Let us move systematically: _x0007__x0007_Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger - educated girls grow into educated women who have been shown to responsibly manage their families' economic interests by allocating funds primarily to the feeding and care of their children, to re-invest in small business, and to prioritize health and well-being. Additionally, the economic contribution by educated women benefits countries on a national level, thus enabling resources to be provided to the nation's poor and hungry. _x0007__x0007_Goal 4: Reduce child mortality - the children of educated women are significantly more likely to reach their fifth birthday. As noted above, education women tend to prioritize the health of their children. They have reduced fertility (and thus can take better care of the children that they do have), allowing them to breastfeed each child longer and ensuring that the family's resources are spread among fewer individuals. _x0007__x0007_Goal 5: Improve maternal health - educated women and girls are more health-literate and thus able to be empowered and take greater control over their reproductive health. Fertility is reduced, and skilled birth attendants are sought out. _x0007__x0007_Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other disease - again, educated women make health a priority, allocate resources to improve/maintain health, and have greater knowledge and funds to seek out medical care when necessary. An improvement in the status of women also reduces the spread of sexually transmitted infections as transactional sex is unnecessary, prostitution becomes less prevalent, and women gain the ability to negotiate sex in relationships. _x0007__x0007_Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability - educated women have the ability to understand and contribute to sustainable practices. Reducing the number of people without access to safe drinking water and sanitation is a consequenc""",1,1,1

"The most effective social/non-medical intervention that can be used to prevent and/or treat HIV/AIDS is education.  While this intervention may enjoy a fair amount of theoretical support, it is practical access to education, for girls and boys, that is required.  Education provides a communal level of understanding for students to discover how HIV is spread and how it can be prevented.  Within a community, this knowledge is shared, as well as the power of the knowledge.  Additionally, students learn while at school to navigate socially; they learn to confidently debate, argue, and compromise.  These are the communication skills that are needed to have the “difficult conversations” concerning health and reproductive choices.  Aware of their increasing prospects through education, students may pause to have a risk/benefit analysis of behaviors that are associated with HIV acquisition._x0007__x0007_While watching and listening to the Gene Richardson’s interview, I was reminded by his gentle manner and good works that another effective social/non-medical intervention is kindness.  Perhaps because kindness is so difficult to graph in a ‘per capita’ sort of way, it is easily overlooked.  Or it could be that it is in short supply, or that it sometimes comes with strings attached.  Kindness can also seem a bit of a luxury.  It is hard to be kind when you are hungry and living on the street.  It is hard to be kind when you have been treated as inevitable war collateral.

"While Goal Two strives to achieve universal primary education, thus directly granting the right to education for girls, one may question whether access to primary education is sufficient to close the educational gap. Further efforts may focus on retention on female students past childhood into adolescence at a point when education may be a more powerful tool in safeguarding a girl's interests. Universal primary education is a giant step in the right direction, but it is in vain if a girl isn't able to stay within the safety net of school for her formative years, if it's just a childhood diversion. _x0007_If a girl embraces an education, she will likely earn more in her life, reducing the chance that she and her family will be hungry and unable to sustain themselves. She will be less likely to engage in risky behavior, less likely to contract disease, and more able to seek care- improving her own health and that of her family. She will likely have fewer children and hence be in a better position to allocate resources.

"MDGs two and three relate directly to girls education for they seem to promote gender balance (sex balance?)in access, enrollment and completion of certain critical education levels. However, these can only effectively be achieved if the socioeconomic changes suggested by the other six goals are being met. For instance, a study conducted by my organization in one of the regions in Uganda indicated that scarcity of water affected school attendance of boys and girls (but most especially the girls) - promoted by MDG 7. Likewise, studies have indicated that one of the most significant challenge to my country's Universal Primary Education is the high prevalence of poverty (MDG 1), especially in the rural areas. Some parents cannot afford to buy books or pencils for their children to use at school. The same goes for the other MDGs. I would conclude by saying, there is likely to be no single MDG that can be achieved in isolation.",1,1,1

"I also agree that all 7 MDGs are related to the education of girls and female adolescents. As Lloyd reported, there are evidences linking education particularly of women and girls with increased family income and gross national product (MDG 1), improved child and maternal health, as well as of gender equality. It is not far fetched to claim that women with education are better aware of how to prevent HIV transmission and more able to negotiate safe sex - especially if they have economic/financial independence and are empowered, and also better able to act in environmentally sustainable manner or contribute positively to environmental management. That is because they have achieved a certain level of capacity and status such that they are involved in community affairs._x0007__x0007_But I must also say that the MDGs - even if many human rights activists and feminists criticized the adoption of the MDGs for failing to promote human rights - did contribute significantly in increasing access to education for girls as well as for boys.

However, one could argue that Primary Education would not be enough to close the gap between the level of education of girls as compared to boys, but it would certainly be a step in the right direction. _x0007__x0007_Goal 3 also relates directly as to promote gender equality from a young age worldwide Goal 2 would have to be fulfilled (meaning all girls would be educated to a Primary Level) and furthermore it would have to become the norm; in every country or culture it would have to be accepted that girls should be allowed to complete Primary Education as boys are expected to, which is not currently the case. _x0007__x0007_Again, one could argue that all of the MDG's are dependent upon educating girls for their fulfilment, as when you educate a girl, you educate a generation (Brigham Young [1<phoneRedac>]), and therefore, the world. _x0007__x0007_But Goal 4 specifically depends on the education of girls for it fulfilment, as it states in the info-graphic provided earlier this lesson; \""A child whose mother can read is 50% more likely to live past age 5\"".

I like his idea of the two armed study to compare the best structural approach to women's negotiating power. It is a medical approach to a social problem and designed in a way that perhaps will communicate the social impact of this disease more easily to medical people. Dr. Farmer is another medical provider who has a good understanding of the personal/social impact of disease, in this instance, HIV.I have worked many years in Harlem and have come face to face with the many difficulties of providing adequate, proactive care to women in poverty.

Educating girls will promote gender equality and empower women, since they will understand that they too are capable of doing work other than the traditional roles they have seen their mothers' and grandmothers' do for countless generations. _x0007__x0007_The goals that are dependent on educating girls for their fulfillment are eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, reduce child mortality, improve maternal health, combat HIV and AIDS, malaria and other diseases, ensure environmental sustainability and develop a global partnership for development. If women are educated they will understand how important it is for them to take care of their own health (mental, emotional & physical) and that it is their duty to do this for themselves and to hold themselves accountable for their own health. Once they understand that this is their responsibility, child mortality rates will decrease through the use of contraception, which will not only decrease birth rates, but combat sexually transmitted diseases. Education will also eradicate poverty and hunger, since economies will improve and women tend to invest their earnings in their families and children. After my first visit to Africa, I was asked what would I do, if I could do anything to change the situation. Without thinking about it for a split second I said, educate girls and put them in the right places where they can make decisions and therefore make changes. It's the only way!",1,0,1

"Dr. Richardson expands the lens of the medical model for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS.

"It was very interesting to re-access these 8 goals, which I have looked at many times before, using the lens created by the readings from this course. Though only goals 2 and 3 directly talk about girls and education, I feel all 8 goals are dependent on educating girls for their fulfillment (some more directly than others)._x0007__x0007_We have seen that goals 4-6 all deal with heath issues which are all reduced when women are educated. Women and children make up a large percentage of the poor and when women are educated they have a better chance of making money and are more likely to direct that money to their families. This deals directly with goal 1. Women are often the water carries, fire wood gatherers, charcoal makers, and farmers. They often deal directly with their environment and need to use it to make daily life work. Education can teach women how to farm and live more sustainably. Obviously the environment sustainability is a lot bigger than that, but I am only speaking to one small piece, one small example.  _x0007__x0007_Finally, goal 8 speaks of new systems, of non-discriminatory systems. It will be essential to have educated women involved in creating these systems. The best way to make sure someone is represented in a system is to have them help create it.",1,0,1
"This week's readings have been both crushing with regard to data, and exciting as outlooks toward the future are hopeful.

"First of all, I would like to say that these videos with Gene were very refreshing.  I certainly felt validated when he commented on how big biomedical ideas take the air out of the social interventions.  He really drove the idea home that some of the smallest (and at times, embarrassingly obvious) interventions can have tremendous impact.  He reminds us that things need not be complicated or convoluted to be useful.  So, thank you for sharing such an enlightening interview._x0007__x0007_In response to the above question, I believe that fresh and somewhat simple interventions can sneak past the barriers that have been discussed at length with respect to combating HIV/AIDS.  First, education for all children is an important piece to solving this puzzle.  That being said, I understand that is a challenging task.  I am reminded of an article I read years ago that profiled an ingenious project for educating street children in South America.  Education \cubes\"" were crafted out of wood and chalkboards.  Inside the cube/box were pencils, chalk, food and other teaching materials.  The cube was mounted on 4 wheels and a rope was attached.  In a small amount of time, with only a few items a \""mobile classroom\"" was created.  This classroom could be easily pulled to town squares, alleys, slums, or other hangouts and children were free to gather around and learn.  Bringing the school to the children minimized significant barriers that would have prevented them from accessing school altogether.  I am unfamiliar with the success of this program, but it separates the notion of schooling from education, focusing more on creative ways to deliver education rather than \""how do we get the kids to our school?\"".  In countries facing high levels of HIV/AIDS, this idea could be modified to fit the terrain, climate or demographic.  This idea of mobile and portable education can also be applied to sexual health education._x0007__x0007_In Ontario, Canada there were studies done on intimate partner violence, and it was found that neighbours, friends and families of victims and perpetrators often knew much more than police did about IPV.  In fact, after the reviews of many domestic violence homicides, it was found that these three groups had a wealth of information about the person(s) or family that, if shared early <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> have prevented the death of the woman and/or children.

"1. Prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) _x0007_This type of intervention would provide medications, counseling, and support for HIV-positive mothers and mothers-to-be. Although there is a biomedical component as evidenced by the distribution of medications, it is also heavily reliant on working with health workers, community leaders, and change agents at the local level to educate women and men about ways to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission.

Furthermore, a prevention-focused intervention directly address the gender-based constraints that contribute to the worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic, especially gender norms and practices that encourage high-risk sexual behavior for men. It is also important to address cultural beliefs that may contribute to HIV prevalence, including those that promote sex with virgins as a way to rid oneself of HIV/AIDS. It is important to begin early by engaging boys in small groups because socialization of gender norms and practices begins at birth. _x0007__x0007_3.

One of the problem identified is related to the inadequate measures taken by the Government to improve women' participation in public and political life and the lack of effective programmes to fight against stereotypes.

The Cedaw commettee condemned the sexual objectifivation of women in advertising and the patriarcal system ruling in the country giving the womam a specific role in the family.

"This is a tricky question to answer in particular concerning the varying social and political contexts of the affected populations. Each intervention must be tailored to the communities' needs and resources.  In many cases, HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment will be similar: such as HIV/AIDS education programs tailored for truck drivers and male frequenters of pool halls. However, there are cultural differences; for instance, while in Honduras men offer their women as service to other men on trips from the mountains to urban areas to sell produce, girls in Africa self-prostitute for cell phones or primary education. In some cases education is what is most needed but illiteracy must be adapted to.In most cases, as mentioned, women are educated on the topic so structures of violence must be combatted._x0007__x0007_I am definitely compelled by the idea that a solution to these problems must include inter-generational dialogue.  In many communities, particularly in Africa, it seems that a high level of importance is still place on elders.  Elders are still considered to be wise and to direct the larger population.  That being said, elders are often stuck between the past and present What was often relevant becomes out-dated.  I believe elders and youth can mutually mentor each other on community customs and the applicability of past customs to current times  When adolescents can learn from unashamed elders, the probability of lasting change is greater_x0007__x0007_The second social/non-medicalintervention that I believe will help women may, in fact, draw on my previous suggestion - and that is micro-finance.  While I do believe that the grievance runs greater than economic disparity, starting adolescent girls with an upper hand economic stability could do wonders to keep them in school,making better decisions, and feel more empowered. Perhaps micro-finance institutions could focus on groups of inter-generational activities.

"I think this question is difficult to answer without knowing the context of the location in which the social/non-medical interventions are to be carried out. The factor of culture is incredibly significant when enacting interventions and must be bottom up. This week I have been programming consultative stakeholder meetings in Lesotho of the major parents, educators, youth leaders, church leaders, and ministers/chiefs. These meetings began as a way to create a policy of open dialogue surrounding sexual and reproductive health issues predominately HIV/AIDS as there are many obstacles in the way between open communication between all of these groups. The main being culture and the taboos surrounding sexual health discussions._x0007__x0007_As for interventions I think that education is the most important in order to make individuals implement these behavioral changes in their life. If information is unidimensional the individual will read it but not create any positive behavioral changes. It is very important to think the stages of behavioral change when creating any intervention. The majority of people in countries with high HIV/AIDS prevalence rates know about the disease and some facts. The real challenge is going from contemplation to enacting change. That is why I propose a multi-modal edutainment strategy. Through using edutainment media it is often more dynamic and allows for psychological identification with characters on the TV/radio/comic to see action towards HIV/AIDS treatment or prevention. I believe through making culturally sensitive edutainment media that individuals will be more likely to have sustainable long term positive behavioral changes._x0007__x0007_The second intervention I propose stems from an experience working at a HIV/AIDS organization for Bangkok's commercial sex workers. Initially the organization gave out unlimited supply of condoms but the usage rate was not a significant increase.

"Gene Richardson's talks were really interesting and valuable. I was previously aware of social interventions but had not heard them described in such an articualted way. So this was really valuable._x0007__x0007_Social interventions, to be effective, need to empower girls and boys, men and women to act responsibly and with respect for the long term. The interventions I'll describe below try to focus on this idea; how can we empower girls to demand respect, and how can we empower boys to give that respect without question?_x0007__x0007_Firstly, as we saw in week two, education is one of the best ways to teach young girls (and boys) their value and potential. In a couple of the readings, \low self-esteem\"" is identified as a risk factor for contracting HIV. It therefore points to the need all girls have to be supported and listened to - school education forms an opportunity for this. If a girl feels her point of view and she as a person are respected and valued by her classmates, then she might be more confident in navigating contraceptive talks with her sexual partner, and demanding the use of condoms or tests. Of course education can also give girls the tools to know both how HIV is transmitted, and how to avoid being infected._x0007__x0007_Secondly, it seems a lot of women are at risk throughout the world because of their financial dependence on men. Whether that be relying on a \""sugar daddy\"" to pay the rent or an unfaithful husband to buy the food. NGOs, councils, government bodies, multilaterals etc need to focus their resources on supporting women to create their own financial independence. KIVA loans and microfinance are a good example here. This financial independence could help some women escape from their dependence on men who  carry the virus and/or behave in a risky way._x0007__x0007_Lastly, it's crucial that whatever structural intervention is put in place for girls and women is also explained and sold to boys and men. Boys and men need to also learn, understand and accept the value of each girl and woman, and her point of view in the context of safe respectful sex and HIV/AIDS.

"The Republic of Macedonia has signed CEDAW and had no declarations, reservations or objections to the treaty.

"I really enjoyed the videos with Gene Richardson. I think his work will be an important contribution to the conversation. _x0007__x0007_I believe that that the one of the msot important social interventions is that of education. We need to start changing how people think about HIV, in that, it is not someone else's problem, it is a problem for all of us. Too many times, persons don't care about the disease because it doesn't affect them or anyone they know. We need everyone working together, so we need for each person to recognize that they have a personal stake in seeing the management and hopefully one day, eradication of the disease. We begin then in every school, teaching persons from an early age the part they can play in the continuing struggle against HIV. _x0007__x0007_We also need to provide an opportunity for more women to negotiate safe sex. I liked the example given by Gene Richardson in giving women $50 and saying use this in whatever way you can to stay HIV free. We need to empower women, since they remain most vulnerable and often times women can't negotiate safe sex because they are dependent on men. So we need to provide them with ways in which they can take back that power. _x0007__x0007_Finally, we need stronger campaigns to eradicate some of the myths about HIV. These include having sex with a virgin with cure you, and AIDS is a homosexual disease. We need to send stronger messages particularly in certain geographical areas where these myths are pervasive.",1,0,1
"I think a key intervention area, as with many issues we deal with, is education. This could perhaps be the most effective means of prevention as it includes most other forms. This could be both in formal and non-formal settings. Introducing sexual and reproductive health education in school curricula around the world means school-going kids are exposed to information on HIV/AIDS from a very early age.By the time they hit puberty and become sexually active, they would have been equipped with enough knowledge to encourage the practice of safe sex or preferably, delaying of sexual experience. Informal education could take the form of sensitization and outreach programs in the various communities, especially those where literacy rates are very low, taking into consideration the gender gaps too.While reading the material for this week, I realised that there has been a reduction in the number of outreach programs geared on HIV/AIDS sensitisation as compared to the 90s when I was growing up and was an active child activist in this area.I think these programs need to be revived because despite the success stories, new infections are still being registered and people seem to be a little less informed about HIV/AIDS. _x0007__x0007_One other thing, as mentioned in the video, is the issue of gender.It is evident that women bear the brunt of this problem because of the way the societies were prevalence rates are higher are set up. Gender roles and the complete disrespect and disregard for women's rights contribute to these problems. I think women should be empowered to take ownership of their rights and demand that they be respected. Empowerment can be in the form of education, skills training, equal employment opportunities, basic health care etc. This gives them the power to make informed decisions when it comes to sex and enables them to negotiate in those situations where they were initially unable to, due to dependence on their partner etc. _x0007__x0007_It looks like a lot of work... it actually is, but strategies employed in the areas where success stories have been registered can also be replicated elsewhere. It is important to note that results may vary due to certain differences, but strategies can be adapted and improvised to fit the different regions, communities etc.",1,0,1
"I think all goals are dependent on girls receiving a relevant and good quality education, tailored for their own circumstances, for their fulfillment. However, educating girls is explicitly targeted in goal 2 \Achieve universal primary education\"", since \""universal\"" includes girls, obviously. Goal 3 also refers to girls' education explicitly in its description (Promote gender equality and empower women: Eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education preferably by 2005, and in all levels of education no later than 2015). In this respect, it catches my attention that education is the only mean of equality which is explicitly referred to in this goal's description, since many of the opportunities that education provides girls with are often decimated by labor inequality. _x0007__x0007_Assuming that education should be taught in a safe place and environment, and focusing on girls, it turns into a shelter that helps girls avoid violence and other risky circumstances thus improving or helping to preserve their health. It also appears to be related to a delay in maternity. Since it is a chance for socialization, it also contributes (or should) to mental health. In this sense, it relates to goals 5 and 6, namely \""Improve maternal health\"" -younger girls are statistically more likely to suffer from pregnancy and childbirth complications- and \""Combat HIV and AIDS, malaria and other diseases\"". School attendance often means less labor hours, and investing their time  in accessing new opportunities that they could have even discovered in school. To my eyes this is key for empowering women and achieving equality (goal 3). _x0007__x0007_Goal 3 is also dependent on the contents that are taught to girls, and so are goals 4 (reduce child mortality), 5 and 6, in my opinion, since girls would learn basic health skills which they would practice themselves (goals 3, 5)and probably teach to their close people (goals 4, 6), they would see their chances of having more control over their own maternity increased (gals 4, 5). Other basic skills assumed to be taught are reading and writing skills. According to the infographic found on this site, literate mothers' babies see their survival opportunities doubled when compared to those of illiterate mothers.

"This is a complicated issue.

Women is patriarchal societies are either required to be submissive and/or asexual while men are encouraged to be promiscuous as a sign of manhood or virility. This is probably one of the most *physical* causes of infection. As men wander from female to female, the likelihood of contracting the virus increases exponentially. The woman at home then, because of basic biological differences has a high chance of then becoming infected. If she bears children subsequent to that, unless she has access to antivirals, she will pass the virus on to potential children and the cycle begins._x0007_Men need to take responsibility that it is THEIR actions that create the crisis and unless the patriarchal society is deconstructed, this will not change._x0007_2) One thing that I agree on, and touched on in a previous section was that gender violence not only consists of physical violence against women, but societal pressures in general that force women to be viewed as something less than livestock. In that vein, they are regularly overlooked and put in last place to receive education, medical attention and any sort of social standing. If women are \""allowed\"" (and I hate using that terminology) to break their chains and become more that mere vessels for bearing male children and are given their full potential as living, breathing human being, then the societal ills will eventfully be significantly reduced.

"Although medical technology and biomedical means can prove to be effective preventions and treatments for HIV/AIDS, it is more important to solve this problem at the structural level. By using medical technology, we are simply solving the problem short-term, but not take into consideration further complex problems that could possibly stem from social inequality again in the future. As such, the following is what I personally consider as effective social/non-medical interventions in preventing/treating HIV/AIDS:_x0007__x0007_First and foremost, I deem education as the most powerful weapon a person could yield to fight injustice and inequality; needless to say, AIDS <i>is</i> a disease caused by social disparity. By educating people about the causes, symptoms, and consequences of this widespread world pandemic, they would be aware of the dangerous implications of exposing/risking themselves to the disease. I believe that as long as one does not live in ignorance, a solution to a problem however complicated would eventually come to light. After all, in the word of author Khaled Hosseini, it is better to be hurt by the truth than comforted with a lie. In this case, the 'lie' is how people are not aware of the consequences their actions--or others'--may pose to their health. Thus, they live in relative security of not knowing what AIDS is capable of doing, which is how they are 'comforted'. However, being educated about HIV/AIDS would prepare people to brace themselves against the possibility of acquiring or even transmitting the disease, enabling them to take necessary preventive measures against it. With that said, this is similar to how people might be paranoid about the possibility of contracting HIV, which is how they are 'hurt', but at least they unchain themselves from living in ignorance that could potentially fatally harm them in the near future. And by 'education', I mean informing people through centers, organizations, government policies, etc. _x0007__x0007_Another social/non-medical intervention in preventing or treating HIV/AIDS is improving the economic status of poor women. As read from the readings in this week's unit (i.e. \Women, Poverty, and AIDS\"", \""Women Are Not Just Transmitters\"", etc.), most women who acquire HIV all have one very definite similarity: poverty. In Paul Farmer's book, the stories of three women--Darlene, Guylene, and Lata all hail from countries or an area from a country that is not economically stable.

Providing proper knowledge about the dangers and vigil of HIV  in these areas to the resource poor and non-educated sector can help a great deal in trying to make them more aware about it. Not only the women, but also the men should be given light about the topic as it is equally dangerous for them.

"Reliance on the biomedical model undermines the introduction of social interventions by fostering the assumption that non-medical interventions are inherently inferior and less effective than medical solutions.  Non-medical interventions to epidemics like HIV/AIDS, however, can not only be effective, but have the potential, in a way that medical interventions do not, of creating long-term structural change that may prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS as well as numerous other diseases.  Beyond disease prevention, the lasting implications of social interventions for human rights and quality of life are far reaching.  _x0007__x0007_For example, outreach and awareness campaigns aimed at eliminating myths and reducing the stigma of HIV/AIDS, and promoting (and providing) free, confidential testing, could reduce the incidence and fatality of the disease by making more people aware of their status and how to either stay negative or live healthily with positive diagnoses.  Beyond this, it could lead to better treatment of people living with HIV/AIDS and fewer negative consequences associated with a positive diagnosis.  If receiving a positive diagnosis had fewer social consequences, people would be much more likely to be willing to receive testing and learn about how to take care of their health, whether positive or negative._x0007__x0007_It is clear from the readings, however, that education alone is insufficient to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.  Many women, for example, know the facts about the disease and how it is spread, and may even know they are at high risk of contracting HIV, but do not have the bargaining power to negotiate safe sexual encounters, or the social power to explore options for alternative ways of defining womanhood. Marital norms that give men sexual license while prohibiting women from advocating for their own needs, and expectations that women must bear children, make it difficult for women and girls the world over to negotiate for safe sex within a marriage, which can place her, and any potential children, at high risk for contracting HIV/AIDS. This suggests that structural interventions aimed at normalizing discussions of sex, sexuality and condom use within relationships - for both men and women - could help empower women to have a voice in their relationships, and empower both men and women to engage in healthier ways of relating.  This could happen through comprehensive sex education, radio and TV shows that normalize the subject matter and make it accessible,",1,0,1
"Given that HIV infection in women and girls is so intrinsically linked with gender equality, it could be argued that any intervention to improve gender equality would contribute to the prevention of this deadly virus. Further, in terms of social or non-medical interventions for the prevention or treatment of HIV, it is very important to ensure that women living with HIV are meaningfully involved in these approaches._x0007__x0007_1) Youth peer education is one example of a prevention programme. Such programmes would involve teenage girls working together to share knowledge about how HIV is spread and how they can protect themselves and how to negotiate safe sex.  Teen boys can also work together to understand HIV prevention and how to be responsible. Such programmes can be adapted by age group, done in schools and through non formal education._x0007__x0007_2) Awareness programmes can take many forms in terms of media campaigns, rallies, ribbon campaigns, etc. World AIDS Day held on 1st December is an example where events are held around the world each year. Awareness campaigns can be targeted at specific populations to provide information on the epidemic. Another example is the Stop Rape Now campaign which addresses sexual violence and includes the linkage with HIV._x0007__x0007_3) Advocating for policy change at national and state level is another form of addressing prevention and treatment. Most countries have signed on to various international agreements including Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS in 2001.  But these commitments typically require advocacy at national level to see these promises turned into legislation and national action plans with resources to put them into action.",1,0,1
"All eight of the millennium development goals are linked to girls’ education on some level.  Goals 2 and 3 are explicitly so, in that they seek to address universal access to primary education and the elimination of gender disparities in education.  Goals 4, 5, and 6 are closely linked to girls’ education as a pathway for empowering girls to understand and exercise autonomy over their sexual and reproductive health.  A girl’s level of education directly impacts the likelihood that she will survive her pregnancies and births as she is more likely to delay sexual activity, pregnancy, and marriage, and to seek appropriate care when birthing, etc.  As this unit’s infographic showed, children whose mothers were educated are 50% more likely live past the age of five.  Similarly, educated girls and women are more likely to take measures to protect themselves and their families from HIV and other STIs and diseases (goal 6).  Our readings also highlighted the economic and environmental impact of educating girls, which addresses goals 1 and 7.  And finally, the inclusion of women in the global partnership for development referenced in goal 8 will only enhance effectiveness, creativity, and change.  This must happen by educating and equipping girls to become global leaders.  _x0007__x0007_In short, girls’ education is a critical starting point for all eight MDGs.  Incredible social, economic, and environmental implications ripple out from the impact of ensuring education that is readily available, high quality, and emphasizes gender equality.

"1. Removal of structural barriers that impede equitible access to resources. In this case, I think the most important intervention to enact is regular, medical and social support. By creating a support system which can advise, advocate for, and take notice of changes from a baseline condition, it is possible for women to develop a broad system for safeguarding their health. These groups can advocate for the appropriateness and utmost importanct of condom use. _x0007__x0007_2. Education is another precondition for protection. Education, whether basic to employ a girl with skills and simultaneous lower the chance of sexual risk-taking, or targeted sexual and health coaching about protecting oneself and family members, education is the crux of AIDS prevention. It is irresponsible when people have knowledge and engage in behavior that threatens themselves and others when they are armed with the means to prevent it; it is unjust and unfair when people are exposed and have no understanding or means to prevent it. _x0007__x0007_3.

Associating an illness in a very illicit way with long-marginalized groups serves two purposes: it further marginalizes these groups and it develops the notion that people outside of these groups are untouched by the illness. The latter is categorically untrue. In order to flesh out the realities of the disease, the truely inflicted and the implications, it's imperative to tease out the taboos that exist about the illness. Part of this comes back to education, teaching people about modes of transmission, etc. The disease has to be normalized for it to stop spreading surrepticiously.""",1,0,0

Education leads to more knowledge about a situation and therefore gives individuals more power to make informed decisions. Education is power and allows people to be empowered._x0007__x0007_In a joint report by USAID/ UNFPA/ UNIFEM entitled “Women and HIV: Confronting the Crisis,” education is described as the key to an effective response to HIV/AIDS. Education not only helps to reduce poverty, but it is also seen as a social mechanism that have help to improve health or in the case of HIV/AIDS prevent diseases. With more knowledge comes more power and it is argued that if women are informed they are better able to make better decisions with regards to their health and well-being. Education can take many forms, from informing individuals about the disease itself; to providing information on preventative practices; to giving people a voice to form support groups for change. Much research has been done on the relationship between education and HIV/AIDS and the data from a 32-country study found that women with post-primary education were five times more likely than illiterate women to know facts about HIV/AIDS. Illiterate women, on the other hand, were four times more likely to believe that there is no way to prevent HIV infection (Vandermoortele & Delamonica, 2000). _x0007__x0007_Based on the joint report, It is also believed that “educated mothers make better use of health care facilities,” which one could assume can help to control the rise of HIV/AIDS due to early intervention especially in new births by simple administration of intravenous medications which have been known to reduce the possibility of a child being infected by HIV by at least 50 %.  In a World Bank publication on HIV/AIDS and Education, good basic education is ranked among the most effective- and cost effective- means of preventing HIV/AIDS; and education is labeled as a “social vaccine” against HIV/AIDS. The report highlights the fact that the risk of HIV/AIDS infection is more than halved for young people, particularly girls, who stay in school and complete a basic education. _x0007__x0007_Providing financial support or microfinance initiatives. _x0007_Microfinance initiatives (MFI) are poverty reduction and empowerment strategies t",1,0,1

"Their relationship with men is the primary problem. Thinking about it too much because of the things they feel powerless over causes headaches, sleep problems and unhappy or sad feelings... All understandable. Their lack of control over the conditions of their lives causes them alot of stress both mentally and physically. The women are expected to do everything to provide for their families, and the are not treated fairly for jobs, or land or credit access. They endure tremendous mental, physical and verbal abuse from their husband which makes them all the more uncertain and insecure about the relationship. Even though they do so much for themselves to support their families, they don't have any control over most aspects of their lives. The selfish men in these women's lives have really taken advantage of the women, whe only trying their best for their families.

It sounds like they have a piece of paper, saying they are married (because they are expected to),but they might as well stay single...at least they may struggle but there would be no abuse for them to endure. I hope one day these women can get more independence from their husbands rein, as well be a voice for future generations to try and bring the love and respect they deserve, so their daughters will not have to go through this and their sons will learn to love,honor and respect the women/mothers of their life.

There is also a concern regarding the \""rush to expand coverage\"" at the sacrifice of quality, and none of the countries are currently considered on target for completion of the MDGs for 2015.

"The numbers on the extend of the spread of violence against women are certainly worrying. The report states low levels of education as one of the major factors to do violence against women or to become a victim of gender based violence.

In fact, many cases have been reported of educated women suffering violence and educated men excising physical,sexual and psychological abuse against their partner. Outlining the risks groups is important, but we have make clear that nobody is immune to domestic violence regardless of the educational, social or cultural background.

If you have experienced fear or intimidation when entering a room full of men, if you have tolerated cat calls when you walked past a construction site, if you have walked home alone at night & experienced terror, then you have experienced the psychological effects of an unequal power structure, of patriarchy.

Whereas, the horse is already long gone from the barn in the developed world. Power structures are deeply entrenched, gender violence deeply subtle, accepted, practiced & embedded in every aspect of life, especially in corporations who's power brokers influence & drive most governments.

"I really appreciated Helen Stacy's point that she is a long term optimist. This is something that resonates deeply in my own experience. Having spent two years as a Peace Corps volunteer in West Africa, I was aware that the predominant view of Africa among my friends and family was of stagnation, victimization, and ignorance. What I always tried to explain is that such unilateral appraisals disguise much of the immense evolution that is occurring there (I use 'evolution' simply to describe change, not necessarily progression). Among other things, Within 3 generations of people many villages have moved beyond a pre-industrial lifestyle with significantly rigid gender norms, to (in my village) emphasizing the education of girls, and the ubiquitous use of cell phones throughout.

"I too was troubled by the percentages of women who condone wife-beating. One possible reason for this is that whenever a particular population or group is abused or oppressed, there are those members of the group who will begin to identify with their oppressor and agree with their abusive behavior. Perhaps this is a somewhat subconscious attempt to curry favor with the abusers in hopes of avoiding the abuse themselves? A second possible reason is religious indoctrination.

"To preface, I am pro-choice. However, there is a disconnect in the literature at it relates to son preference. As you note, aborting a baby for the sole reason that the fetus is female is horrific.

However, the section on abortion later on makes no qualifiers on it's usage, even if I agree that a woman has the right to choose, there is a contradiction here that we cannot ignore.

She has spent (and I have given her) thousands of dollars for lawyers to try to fight for her kids because he has the advantage due to his position, power and connections. Of course women from disadvantaged economic situations have terrible situations, but it is such a mistake for people to think that middle class or more economically advantaged, educated women do not experience similar levels of misery, terror and disenpowerment in the face of the system that is supposed to be protecting them.

"The video \From Fear to Freedom\"" was very well done and highlighted the problem of violence against women all over the world in many ways. The photography in the video was very stark and even scary, which I think is necessary to emphasize the importance of this subject. The speakers in the film are fantastic and had such good thoughts and ideas. The problem is so overwhelming and widespread that it can invoke a sense of hopelessness. However, the ideas for methods to try to enact change leave one feeling a sense, that yes, this can be overcome. I particularly liked the idea of public education being used in conservative religious areas to educate about religious 'beliefs' that are actually not part of the Koran, Bible etc. I was a bit taken aback when Asmar Khader of Jordan said progress had been made in the area of 'honor' killings and they showed that some man had gotten a 3 month sentence! How appalling, but I guess it is better to start somewhere. Jacqeline Pitanguy of Brazil talked about police education, which I think is very important as often police are some of the first to be at the scene and have a reputation for looking the other way or taking a man at his word against the woman. Social media is a great idea in terms of reaching economically advantaged women but those who are more disadvantaged wouldn't really benefit from this. This also brings me to the concept of having more women involved in armies as soldiers or working in the policeforce, as was mentioned in the video, to try to 'level the playing field' so to speak. I think this does not work well. Think of all the cases of sexual abuse against female soldiers that are reported. I am certain that many many more are not reported. I loved what Mary Robinson said about the low rates of females being involved in peace processes. And the excuse is that women aren't trained? Give me a break! Just another way that men retain the power and control. She is correct, women need to be equal participants in these processes. I also appreciated the example of men being educated in Nigeria, in particular young boys, who can grow up without these preconceived ideas that they must control and abuse women and use violence against them. It is important to look at the big picture, and hard to be patient when this violence should stop NOW, but little by little, change will happen.""",0,1,0

"As a health care provider, this article really drove home to me the difficulties of bring up the subject of violence in the health care setting. At least, the difficulty and discomfort that I have with this topic. There are so many problems: if the guy is in the room, how to get him out if he is controlling? Sometimes he even goes to the bathroom with her. She won't speak up in front of him but can't tell him to leave. The situation is clear but there is no opportunity to address the woman alone. I remember well a case like this of a 'mail order bride' who was clearly being victimized. I felt like I failed because I never, during the entire pregnancy, was able to get one private word with her. I later found out that she had escaped and was going through legal channels to be able to keep her child and I was able to help at that time with documentation of my observations. But I wonder what hell that woman's life was and if there was something else I could have done. Even if the man is not in the room, often it is so difficult. I live in an area with very few resources. What can I recommend that she do? What options does she really have? I really appreciated the ideas in this article on different ways to bring up the subject without being totally direct, placing the power of the decision whether to divulge the violence at the discretion of the woman, rather than her having to get defensive. I liked these ideas so much that I am going to bring this to the office with me. I would like to also say that even though girls and women who have lived with abuse are statistically more likely to end up in these relationships (at least in the U.S.), that is not the only risk factor. When my daughter was having a low moment in her life she fell into a relationship with a man who was controlling and psychologically abusive.

"The idea (reality) that male children are preferred in nearly every country seems jarring to the ear, but I think a very important step in understanding the world we live in and have been socialized in is to first realize that there is inequality and preferences on lines of gender (and race/sexuality/gender identity/size/ability/etc.) work only as products of this inequality and as reinforcement to this injustice.

Programs like this are necessary as a temporary bandage to a larger problem.

"I am from India and have heard about violence, HIV/AIDS, sex workers, unfair treatment regarding education to boys and girls, Family wanting birth of a son. When i was in school we used to read about it in textbooks, there would be tv documentaries and announcements on radios making people aware about how birth of a girl is equally good, how boy or girl child both should be given equal education become it is a girl child who grows and educates her family, her children and is vital to overall growth of their own family. However, I live in Mumbai, it is a city and there has been a noted change in people's thinking, mostly working group of people live here. People try to educate their children including girls provided the resources they have. I would proudly say even people from lower income groups think that having one girl child is good enough to complete a family. _x0007_Well, I thought in cities mainly the perception of people has changed.

"The interview with Gene Richardson tackles what I believe to be imperative when tackling HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, particularly as we’re aiming to approach these issues through the lens of human rights. Similar to the education argument—more girls in schools means more girls in the workplace means a better GDP means a better world—taking a look at a disease so fully entrenched in additional contexts through the sole lens of medicine can be problematic. _x0007__x0007_When considering social and/or non-medical interventions that might be effective in preventing or treating HIV/AIDS, it’s a different kind of chicken-before-the-egg problem. As we’ve been discussing throughout this course, many of the issues women across the globe are facing are closely intertwined with larger issues and broader social/economic/political contexts. I mention this only as a reminder—for myself and for the reader—of the boundaries and challenges my recommendations face. _x0007__x0007_My recommendations all stem from education: 1.) improved access and education quality for girls and 2.) improved sex education for both boys and girls. _x0007__x0007_Improving access to and quality of education for girls has a number of possible benefits. Over the last two weeks, we’ve seen studies and readings mention time and time again that the more educated girls are, the less likely they are to marry later and to practice safe sex. Not to mention educated girls are more likely to be personally empowered, gain respect in the community and have more opportunities to pursue a healthier economic situation. All of these can help reduce their chances of contracting HIV/AIDS. While it’s clear to see the correlation between marrying later and practicing safe sex, I think the latter points are most interesting and pertinent to prevention and treatment. Ideally, the more empowered girls are around the world and the more respected they are in their communities, the less likely they are to be entrenched in extreme poverty—where many risk factors lie. Of course, it’s important to remember how they’re receiving this education and the various risk factors of sexual favors and debt bondage to receive access to schooling. _x0007__x0007_In addition to improving education across the board, I am a huge advocate that improved sex education can greatly influence HIV/AIDS prevention.

"Education is internationally acknowledged to benefit individuals and promote national development. It is widely recognized as the gateway to economic security and opportunity. Education and training remain important elements to any effort to eliminate gender inequality. If this sounds right, the critical question becomes: whether expanding educational and training opportunity for women is enough to eliminate the gender inequalities which continue to characterize our society? Can development efforts succeed with the persistence of gender inequalities? There is a need for clear and efficient policies that watch over the avoidance of all forms of gender inequalities. It is crucial to have a clear vision and objective for all the policies concerned with the establishment of gender equality. The education for all goals represents an international and national commitment to eliminate gender disparities in primary and secondary education by 2005 and to achieve gender parity throughout education 10 years later. However, education does not have the same benefit for males and females. The obstacles created by policies to female access to education are meant a loss of the opportunity for many women to break through the gender inequality arising from the prevalence of a gender–biased tradition. Furthermore, literacy and education are important determinants of economic growth and women’s education may be especially important for long–term growth. The current growing interest and increasing concern in the gender equality issues in the literature is consistent with the increasing commitment towards fulfilling MDG 2&3 by 2015.",1,1,1
"The 8 goals the UN set in 2000 Millennial Development Goals (known henceforth as the MDGs) are (1-8): 1. Eradicate extreme Poverty and Hunger_x0007_2. Achieve universal primary education_x0007_3. Promote gender equality and empower women_x0007_4. Reduce child mortality_x0007_5. Improve Maternal Health_x0007_6. Combat HIV, AIDS, malaria and other diseases_x0007_7.

The 1st, 6th, 7th, and 8th are gender neutral at first glance but all 8 are related (if not directly) to the education of girls. _x0007_   It's obvious that the MDGs #s 2-5 deal directly with women and girls. Primary education for all was a drastic goal to set 13 1/2 years ago. The statistics on girls dropping out before graduating from primary school have been dismal. It is as Professor Murray's title of her book it is outrageous. 50% were reporting dropping out in 1995 by the 4th grade level. Only 34% reported graduating primary school and 64% reported dropping out before becoming fully literate (pg 48-49 in the book from Outrage to Courage). _x0007_   It's also obvious that MDGs #s 4 and 5 (dealing with child care and maternal death) will be effected by the young women and girls being educated. The sway of having a generation of educated women to know how to know what to do in time of crises by having the ability to negotiate, know their rights, read manuals of needs be.

"I was very affected by the reading from Paul Farmer's book and then the discussion of structural violence in the video with Gene Richardson. I had not come across this concept of structural violence before, at least not presented in this manner, and it makes a lot of sense to me now. All along it has been clear that the conditions we have been discussing in various classes are caused by an underlying structural negative bias towards the weak and most vulnerable in our society . Be it in the developed world, Darlene's example in Harlem, or someone in Asia or Africa. The issues of racism, sexism and poverty exacerbates and exposes these weakest segments of society to epidemics like AIDS. And even amongst the weakest there is a hierarchy and women occupy the last rung on the ladder therefore they are the most unfortunate and most vulnerable. _x0007__x0007_There are two social interventions I think that hold the most promise in the long run. It is economic empowerment and education and I would stress the order in which these interventions should be administered. Economic empowerment is primary. You cant educate a kid if he or she is hungry or doesn't have a roof over her head. If there is enough food, decent shelter and a reasonable guarantee of income then education does wonders and if education is free than it goes to the last wrung on the ladder i.e. parents send their girls to school as we have read in the earlier readings. Economic empowerment perhaps is not a panacea to cure deep held cultural and religious beliefs that in most cases adversely impact girls but in the long term education helps change hearts and minds. _x0007__x0007_The other thing I think would immensely help is to bring more men in this dialogue. Of course most of the organizations working to help women are founded and run by women leaders but we need to do a better job of making the men, who are still the primary policy and decision makers in societies around the world, see the value of empowered women. All awareness is fruitful and I have learnt a great deal from this class so far but sometimes I feel we are preaching to the choir. I would be very interested in learning about how many men are actually taking this class which is eye opening and which hopefully helps us all, men and women, in making a little bit of difference in how we are operating in this world.

Goals 4 and 6 depend upon girls being educated about their own sexual and reproductive health, in order to successfully avoid contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted infections and unplanned pregnancies. This is equally essential for goal 5, which requires that women have access to knowledge about family planning and contraception, and about their own bodies, in order to avoid maternal complications (especially those which come about as a result of a mother being too old or too young, or having had too many children, or too little time for her body to recover between pregnancies._x0007__x0007_Ultimately, it is absolutely essential to include women's voices and experiences in developing the solutions to these problems.

"I agree with much that has been written on the post already. Education, primarily girls education, is a main factor. To add on to what has already been said, I think that we need to reflect on different educational delivery mechanisms.

We should ensure that education is not only classroom setting but also that we engage in non-formal educational methods such as interactive sessions and theatrical methods. _x0007__x0007_Some other areas would be communication. We need to ensure that the material we develop is not only targeted for those it serves but that we also empower those same groups to develop tools. We need to ensure that tools (like TeachAids), involves the beneficiaries in the development and evaluation of the products. This helps ensure that the material is best suited for the groups. For example, NGOs that develop material for groups only to learn later those images were offensive or that many women couldn't read and needed more graphics helps build stronger material. _x0007__x0007_I have read about some NGOs using SMS reminders for HIV medication.

"There is also an additional question. There is no question that literacy and education is an imperative, particularly for girls but also boys. It is the foundation, yet not the sole issue, for receiving sufficient information to make informed decisions on life’s crucial choices, such as reproduction. And the corollary to education is generating openings for economic activities, either formal or informal. Otherwise a perverse outcome can be that a young woman (or man) can receive enough education to aspire not to live their parent’s lifestyle, but they have no opportunity to move on, raising the prospect that they become unemployed urban slum dwellers. Which raises a very challenging question: if potential for employment to match education standard does not exist, but the avenue to continue family substance type living remains, to what level should a person be educated?",1,1,1

"I absolutely agree with you NatMoon. All 8 MDGs are dependent on educating girls for their fulfillment. According to the WHO Executive Summary on Women and Health, (2009), \within countries, the health of girls and women is critically affected by social and economic factors, such as access to education, household wealth and place of residence. In almost all countries, girls and women living in wealthier households have lower levels of mortality and higher use of health-care services than those living in the poorest households. Such differences are not confined to developing countries but are found in the developed world.\"" This effectively addresses Goals 1 and 8 as it affects women, especially in low-income countries struggling with development._x0007__x0007_Sexuality and reproduction are central to women's health.

"HIV and AIDS education can take place in many different environments, from classes at school to families and friends sharing knowledge at home. It is important that this education is provided in a variety of settings to ensure that the most vulnerable and marginalised groups in society are reached, and that accurate information about HIV and AIDS is reinforced from different sources. The most common place for people to learn about HIV and AIDS is at school. Due to their capacity and universality, schools are a crucial setting for educating young people about HIV/ADIS As young people are at a high risk of becoming infected with HIV, it is vital that they are educated about HIV transmission before they are exposed to situations that put them at risk of HIV infection (for example, before they are sexually active). Schools play a major role in shaping the attitudes, opinions and behaviour of young people and so are ideal environments for teaching the social as well as the biological aspects of HIV and AIDS. Members of the wider community can also increase their knowledge about HIV and AIDS through the school environment. Teachers who expand their understanding of the subject while planning lessons and receiving teacher training can pass this information on to adults as well as pupils, and the same can be said for children themselves; once informed about AIDS, they can tell their parents or their friends what they have learned Educating people at work is an important way of providing people with vital prevention information, and can reach people who have previously missed out on HIV and AIDS education. Furthermore, it is estimated that nine out of ten people living with HIV are working. Providing education in the workplace is important for protecting those at work living with HIV, and for helping them to live healthily and stay in work",1,0,1
"In order to address these goals, it is imperative to support women working on these issues within their own communities as well as globally.

"Being impoverished and being female are two of the greatest risk factors for contracting HIV-AIDS; these are the most important issues to address. Setting up ways of survival outside this impoverishing and unequal capitalist global economy that devalues females is essential to promoting women's health, education, and empowerment. Women must work outside of the systems that oppress them in order to remove themselves from secondary social positions that leave them powerless. Setting up women's communities to educate females, provide income and housing, and safety from oppressive males is, in my opinion, the best way of removing the threat of HIV/AIDS (as well as other symptoms of structural violence) from women's lives.",1,0,1

Girls must be encouraged that their education matters, and provided an opportunity to be educated in a way that does not place a greater financial burden on their families.

At the same time even if they finished up to secondary levels, only few are able to reach the college levels, much more the post graduate levels. If you are looking for quality education, it is quite expensive in the country. Thus, ordinary people will send their students to substandard schools just to get a diploma.

VAW is about power: who has power over whom – where the latter is almost always the women. It is about male domination over women and how society at times tends to tolerate it through its tradition, culture and religion. Though the definition illustrated in the book is not really new to me as I have been involved in the lobbying for the passage of our Anti-Violence Against Women and Children Law where we highlighted the various forms of VAW and how it impacts to women (from physical, emotional, economic, and health related costs); but what I like in the book is that it was able to clearly discussed th""",1,0,1
"Three social/non medical interventions that might be effective in preventing or treating HIV/AIDS:_x0007__x0007_1. Teach Our Boys That Girls Are Just As Good As Them: We have talked often about women's lack of power in their relationships and how this merged with the prevailing patriarchal notions internationally puts women in vulnerable high risk situations. I think we need to begin to educate boys/young men as they are growing up and developing their values and ideas about their place in the world; that women are of VALUE and are their EQUALS. This dialogue would begin in schools because these institutions are grounds for having open minded discussions, but it also would rely on older male figures being the champions of this message - because let's face it men seem to only listen to men. _x0007_2. Empower Women And Girls: Mothers, daughters, sisters, grandmothers, (and all females) need to know they are worthy and valuable. This is not only education but also begins in the home with how parents talk to their daughters and how brothers treat their sisters. Empowerment could look like all-girl schools that focus on supporting girls and allowing for them to be sheltered from male oppression as their minds develop. Women groups in rural communities where schools are not as feasible can reach into homes and village life, where they can have weekly conversations around women's issues (like sex, marriage, job skill development, child care, self care) and so create a safe space and hopefully - women who know their worth. Educating the community on how women are the center of a families well being would also begin to influence how women are viewed in their homes._x0007_3. Policy (Because Laws Still Matter): We need to get countries to understand women's plight and how it directly affects their countries growth and capitol. The U.N. and the powerhouse industrialized countries need to be held accountable to women and pass the laws and mandates that put women's issues parallel with human right's issues. I agree with enacting a marriage law of over 18, or a law that enforces primary education for all children. I also think that the western industrialized countries have huge influence (socially and financially) on many developing countries and should use this for the benefit of helping to enact regulations and policies in these countries that would benefit women.",1,0,1

Both child mortality and maternal health are often defined as healthcare issues, and thus ensuring proper medical clinics, trained medical staff, affordable healthcare, etc. are available is often seen as the main fix to such issues.  However, and not taking away from those things, as they are indeed crucial to proper health, often they are not enough.  In addition to these things, proper education for the women who are generally charged with such issues at home could help ensure medical advice is taken and properly applied.

Education in general gives people critical skills and tools to help them better provide for themselves and their children. It also helps people work better and can create opportunities for sustainable and viable economic growth now and into the future.

Opportunity on education and health are equally provided for both men and women. We have public schools and universities and public health centers. During the colonization in 1<phoneRedac> up to the end of ww2 the role of women and equality in the Philippines was not ideal. During Marcos regime the country was also in turmoil.

Information is a very great agent and tool for change. To affect the present generation and the future, channels most accessible should be used; e.g. radio and television. In many rural/local areas in Nigeria for instance, transistor radios are not only a tool for entertainment but also the inhabitants access to news around the world, thanks to the BBC Africa. Mediums like this have been able to develop locally syndicated radio programs, in the local dialect for broadcast to create awareness about issues of reproductive health, HIV/AIDS, education, etc. To a large extent, this gets people talking because they can relate the enactment over the air to their own lives. TV also is able to deliver this message through enriched, issue related programming, e.g. Shuga TV which presents the TV series across several West and East African countries http://www.shuga.tv/ _x0007__x0007_This brings me to my second thought on a social intervention that is relevant, which is influence through traditional and religious leaders. It is common knowledge that leaders hold a position of great influence in the lives of their followers. One can immediately refer to Zainaba [Opening the Gates] to see a first-hand interpretation of the influence of her position in the society of midwives and nurses. Her instruction resonated to this group, who will in turn perform and advise women around them on the practice of FGM/C differently. That is change! - minimal but non-the-less effective. If government agencies, NGOs, and social groups are able to build an understanding about preventing or treating HIV/AIDS in community leaders, church priests, imams, muslim clerics and such, they will influence their community of followers in this knowledge, who will in turn change their ideologies, attitudes and misinformed social conformity on the subject.",1,0,1

The idea of our reliance on medical technology and the corresponding devaluing of social sciences is obviously very troubling._x0007__x0007_Perhaps the most self-presenting of the social interventions that may be used in preventing the spread of HIV are the **fostering of gender equality** and the **education of women and girls, including family planning and sexual health education.** Gene touched upon these in his interview and I feel they deserve at least as much attention as medical interventions against HIV._x0007__x0007_Through fostering gender equality - through schemes which empower women with work skills, leadership abilities and self-esteem and initiatives which create opportunities for women to join the workforce - we create a society in which women are economically and socially empowered to support themselves and their families without increasing their own risk factors through prostitution. On the other side of this, I would like to recommend community-based education for groups of men on the topics of women's and children's rights and ethical responsibility. It seems to be that an inordinate amount of responsibility for HIV contraction is placed on women, when of course the crux of the control of the spread of the disease is in the hands of their husbands. The kind of cultural change we need to impact in order to see men understanding their own sexual behaviours and their potential damage as something they need to control with contraceptives and respect for others is obviously tremendous and will take a long time to achieve, but this should not be used as a reason to lessen our efforts._x0007__x0007_Secondly, the education of women and girls - particularly on the topics of sexual health and rights and family planning - are intrinsic to the fight against the spread of HIV.

This is needed in both developed and developing countries.

There could be creative ways of incorporating the community into this - for example, having local women come in and lead portions._x0007__x0007_A last idea which comes to mind is around the creation of a video game where the player acts out the antiretroviral drug going through the human body.

"I loved reading the book “From Outrage to Courage.” Even from the very subtitle, “The Unjust and Unhealthy Situation of Women in Poorer Countries and What THEY Are Doing About It,” Professor Murray seems to turn traditional power dynamics on their head. We are not posed as students learning only how to help the atrocious Human Rights inequalities in the world, but learning how those disenfranchised women are helping themselves gain power, in this global human rights movement, as part of the third wave of feminism discussed in the last chapter. “They,” women of the world, are taking their power and voice. “They” are not asking other authorities to give them power, but demanding it, in her statement. I add the emphasis to the word “they” because I see the very use of “they” versus “we” gives the power, control and agency not to “us”  students, other members of society, or men, to save women, but back to the women themselves to help run their lives. Helping those in need is a beautiful thing, but to create something local, sustainable, allowing autonomy is even more important.  This wording choice seemed very deliberate to me, and I so enjoy the empowering context it sets up for the rest of the book._x0007__x0007_I enjoyed the Forward from Paul Farmer. I respect him and have read some of his other writings.

However to make some effort, to help women seems more manageable. “Neither are you free to abandon it” are words that will stay with me after this class. _x0007__x0007_In Chapter One, the widespread lack of desire for girls, and efforts to attain such, shocked me. I expected this in a few areas of the world, but did not realize how widespread it is. I love that this book discusses these as human rights and a problem of justice, not just economics. As Murray discusses, to discuss problems facing women only in economic terms really does not address their humanity and inherent worth.",1,0,1

"I think it is interesting that the Unites States is not a party to the Convention to Elimination All Forms of Discrimination Against Women treaty. Professor Stacy discussed America's \allergy\"" to treaties and strong sense of sovereignty. On one hand I understand why the US is reluctant to do anything that may decrease sovereignty. But if the US signed it seemed that may help some other countries. It seems very odd in many ways, although we encourage these things in other countries, the US sometimes feels above signing the treaty itself. It is also interesting if the pro-life debate has influenced this decision. _x0007__x0007_Looking at the list of reservations of who has signed, peaks my interest in International Human Rights Law. It also speaks to how difficult it may be to enforce HR and bring violations to justice. I wonder how international legal precedents would work with everyone signing the same treaty, but adopting their unique reservations.   Also it makes me think if changes are being made at the top levels of government I wonder if any of the concepts \""trickle down\"" to the people of the country, or if they are signed for political gains.""",1,0,1
"A pit in my stomach and a gasp of air. That is the best way to describe my reaction to reading about how you can pay a \birth attendant\"" to snap a baby girls spinal cord, and then have it recorded as a still born in a part of India. (Murray 29)_x0007__x0007_The story about the father who would go to the river to kill his few day old newborn daughters, and after doing this a few times he kept his daughter unable to do it again, provoked a similar response._x0007__x0007_These stories highlight how being a woman, there is difficulty even in surviving prenatal growth and infancy.  _x0007__x0007_I think professor Murray is detailing the \""Outrage\"" women face to us, in bold terms you don't normally hear. It may not be pretty, but it is truth, and it must be known before any \""Courage\"" and change can come. _x0007__x0007_I think other than a complete paradigm shift of the valuing of women to occur, which is completely necessary, it is also very smart for a country to do what China did to create incentives to raise girls. Shifting raising a daughter from being a burden, to at least a neutral part of the family if they get tax incentives and education for the girl, can help decrease deadly alternatives. (Murray 33) These policy shifts can affect the family in a direct way, and somewhat combat female infanticide and sex based selective abortion. Girls need to be seen as a positive for change. _x0007__x0007_This was a difficult chapter to read. And the problem is far wider spread than I had know before.

An additional reason is complex national constitutions which make domestication difficult. It is apparent that \sovereignty\"" is a sacrifice that has to be made to fully give attention to these instruments. Nigeria has passed provisions of CEDAW and CRC.

This is something I struggle a lot in my classes.

It’s hard to find word for such type of low intellectual understanding of that need. It’s comparable to keep someone with tied hands because you don’t realize his need to use hands for eating.
