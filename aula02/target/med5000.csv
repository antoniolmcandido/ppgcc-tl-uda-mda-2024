Think of it this way: you are in a position in which you know exactly what it is like to not understand a sentence due to complicated sentence structure.

As I said in the previous section, I feel strongly that in some of the examples here as well as in the previous section, cutting the clutter resulted in over-simplification and loss of precision. The trade-off between readability and precision is not trivial and should be taken into account on a case-by-case basis.

It seems from the original sentence, the paper does not provide a complete overview of Quantum Physics, but only an overview of the basic principle.

The Madagascar Hissing cockroach was used because of: its larger size (~50-75mm), slow speed (~3cm/s), long life span (~2 years) and robustness. Latif and Bozkurt developed a wireless biological interface, that uses an electronic stimulus, to remotely steer cockroaches by way of their antennae (called cerci) to sense: tactility, temperature and humidity. Researchers used these antennae to drive the cockroaches by sending a series of electrical pulses to them. This concept helps to create a mobile web of sensors that use cockroaches to collect and transmit data, to enable locating survivors in inaccessible areas during earthquakes._x0007_ _x0007_The system consists of: a microprocessor with Zigbee interface* electrodes and a battery. The user controls the microprocessor wirelessly using a Zigbee transceiver; the microprocessor sends electrical pulses to the cockroach’s antennas using electrodes and then the cockroach moves. The researchers evaluated two microprocessors that control the electrodes: Microchip's PIC16F630#  and Texas Instrument’s CC2530^. The CC2530 was better because: of its low weight (500mg), Zigbee module connectivity and the availability of 21 general purpose I/O. The CC2530 gets its power from the 90mAh Li-Po battery._x0007_  _x0007_Before the experiment started, the cockroaches were anesthetized by cold-treatment (4C) for 45-60 minutes. They attached one side of the electrodes (5cm long stainless steel coated with 250um thick Teflon) to the antennae to serve as electronic reins, which injected small charges into the roach’s neural tissue. The charges trick the roach into thinking that the antennae are in contact with a physical barrier, which effectively steers them in the opposite direction._x0007__x0007_The cockroaches followed an S-shaped trajectory drawn on the laboratory floor and spent 81 sec. with 10% success rate to complete the route.

However, the unique thing is, when the object comes first, the sentence is turned into an active voice by using another verb to drive the noun form of the original verb. It feels very natural too. For example, \samples are treated with ethylene prior to... \"" is turned into \""samples uses ethylene treatment...\"". When I read the second construction in Chinese, I'll just pickup \""samples\"", \""ethylene treatment\"" instinctively. Forcing the sentence to go passive would be really bizarre to me._x0007_Anyhow, what I am trying to say is, maybe the preference on active voice is just a property of language itself, rather than just English. Why would we engage in an effort to betray the instinct and make ourselves sound formal/objective/authoritative... when there is no good reason to do so. Tradition is never a good reason.""",1,1,1

"Just my opinion... but after reading tons of posts, I believe too many are taking this course way too seriously.  This is a  non-credit course.  There is no verification process to establish the one receiving a certificate is the one who completed the assignments.  Most complain about how their grades were unjustified--the goal is to learn to write better, not to get a 3 rather than a 2.  If a reviewer is unfamiliar with content, wouldn't it be honest to admit that?  There is no mechanism for a reviewer to omit a grade if content is beyond them.  Also, it is obviously commendable that everyone is working hard, but effort does not necessarily equate to high marks.  In the old days there were grades for effort distinct from grades for content knowledge.  There is no such thing here.  If a reviewer can't suggest any  improvements for any reason, it'd be better not to make some up.",1,1,1

On October 18, 2013 New York Times health and science reporter Gina Kolata wrote about Aronowitz’s articles and the underlying study in “Decades Later, Condemnation For a Skid Row Cancer Study.”  The study subjects--skid row alcoholics--were offered room and board for a short stay if they allowed the researchers to perform prostate biopsies “in a very interesting part of their anatomy.” (Kolata, A3)  If found to be positive, those subjects were provided free medical followup.  Weaving together interviews, assessments by medical historians and analyses of the original Aronowitz articles, Kolata wrote a devastating critique of the project and practically all involved in it.

He wanted to show that prostate cancer could be detected early on, treated and cured, and as Kolata notes “a laudable goal” (Kolata, A3), except that Hudson chose “skid row” alcoholics to be his subjects and his methodology incorporated invasive biopsies—a scenario made worse by Hudson’s lack of full disclosure.  He picked men from Bowery flophouses , homeless, penniless men who were often mentally ill alcoholics unlikely to understand what was involved; and who, even if aware, were powerless to do much about it.  Administrators ensured the “volunteers’” continued attendance in the program by withholding their meal tickets.

If detected, it was discovered late, after metastasis, and usually fatal.

She was visiting her mother’s brother Gopal who was a lower division clerk in the state government. Although Gopal’s position in the government was among the lowest in the government machinery, he was a respected man in his village by virtue of his employment. Employment in the government was aspirational amongst the youth in Jharsa where he also grew up as a child. A government employment not only ensured secure employment and a regular monthly income but also a state pension on retirement.

Hop protein is classified within the family protein <zipRedac> (STI<zipRedac>) inducible by stress; It’s a co-chaperone from the two major Heat Shock Chaperone (Hsp7<zipRedac>/9<zipRedac>); and facilitates the polypeptide folding or unfolding: Choice of target protein, presentation to Hsp7<zipRedac> or Hsp9<zipRedac> and coordination of the bonding cycle and release of the Heat Shock Complex (Fink, <zipRedac>999;Whitley et al., <zipRedac>999)._x0007__x0007_An structural analysis by Hernández et al., in 2<zipRedac><zipRedac>2 revealed the presence of TPR or Tetratricopeptide repeats in the protein.

The C-terminal domain of 7<zipRedac> aa, it’s rich in Asp-Pro repeats, and its named DP<zipRedac>. Finally the region of <zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac> aa between TPR<zipRedac> and TPR2A have a duplication of DP domain, followed by a hinge region. But, Hop have different structures, the research group demonstrated some exceptions, the absence of DP<zipRedac> domain in Glycine max and DP2 in Arabidopsis thaliana indicating redundant functions, essential for some species but not for all in vivo protein activities. _x0007__x0007_Hop gene contains six introns but, how genomic introns were formed? Sine a long time, two theories have existed: Intron-early theory, present at the beginning of life; and Intron-late, inserted much later in an uninterrupted coding sequence (Da Lage et al., 2<zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac>). Hop supports the first, it has an intron phase distribution with excess of phase <zipRedac>, demonstrating that it have been inserted at early stage of its evolution. Which would explain the origin of three TPR domains in these species by recombination. This theory allowed to hypothesize the presence of hypervariable regions (DP<zipRedac> and 2 domains) without relation with some protein functions (Hernández Torres et al., 2<zipRedac><zipRedac>9)._x0007__x0007_In conclusion, Hop arose from successive duplication of initial module which contained one TPR-DP domain.

I will do that. After reading the chicken little posts I feared submitting essay 1 because of the potential for getting zero's even if unintended.  Nonetheless, I did--I had to. I use Chrome and everything went as staff planned.  All my quizzes, lectures, homework, essays, grading were accepted with no problem whatsoever.  There was nothing at all that went awry.  I'm not saying I'm pleased with my grades but that is not the fault of the staff and it does not relate to any software issue.  Sure, the overall course could be improved in plenty of ways, but the bottom line is the present system works and I think I have the agreement of the silent majority who did not bombard this board with annoying complaints.

All this would involve is having a quick skim of the comments and ticking a box to say \this review is fair\"". The additional workload would be minimal. A fair review would be one in which the grades in each section are justified in the reviewers comments - the checker does not necessarily have to agree with the score, they are really just making sure that the essay has been actually been reviewed and the grade is consistent with the comments. If comments are absent, nonsensical, or inconsistent with the grades (due to the reset problem), the review would be rejected and the reviewer would have to review another essay in order to progress. It would not be possible to see your own essay results until you have given four verified reviews._x0007__x0007_Thoughts?""",1,1,1

For instance I got 2's across the board by a reviewer but the essay had not been edited at all, so I have clue no where it was awkward and boring; where it was full of clutter; where the disorganization lay, etc...you get the drift.

"I dont think there should be a lower word limit. If the author is able to provide all the necessary information in 150 words, he should not be penalized for it.

They explained how and what previous experiments had performed, as well as what the experiments had not performed.

"In revising the writing assignments 1 and 2 of my peers I found -in at least 3 essays- that the \instructions for authors\"" (the assingment instructions) are NOT met. For example: a) the words are much less than 300 and/or b) the writing of the essay does not match with any of the suggestions given by the teacher. For example in assignemnt 1 i recieved an essay on Dolphins when the suggestions where to write about a published paper or a person in science. The current metrics for measuring the output of the assignments has to incorporate a item where the instructions are met, in a similar way than in plagiarism (e.g. being able to flag a essay that does not meet the instructions). Accomplishing the instructions for authors is a vital aspect of the publication process so I would suggest that a metric for this aspect is incorporated in the current way of grading.

">  I ended up with accredited points that could count towards a degree if I so desired. However, Stanford isn't the same type of organization_x0007__x0007_Good post, Michaela. One of the directions of some MOOCs is towards this. MOOCs are ideal for bridge courses and prerequisites necessary for a taking a regular university course. This way, the teaching staff can focus on higher value courses and research._x0007__x0007_Still, it isn't fair on my part to compare MOOCs with regular classroom courses. Distance education using postal services has been around in many countries for several decades. Two decades ago, interactive livecast of classrooms to satellite campuses were popular in the US. This approach then carried over to the Internet in the mid 90s. Many of these \remote\"" courses were also recognized, and contributed to a degree. Most courses had a fee. MOOCs are an extension of that. They have come a long way since 1999 when MIT placed its entire academic courseware online at ocw.mit.edu, totally free of cost. They changed the game. Last year MIT and Stanford teamed up and invested to launch Venture Lab (now NovoEd). There are some amazing MOOCs there, two of which I am currently taking. Most are free. https://novoed.com/_x0007__x0007_(sorry for going OT)""",1,1,1

I am actually a reviewer for multiple journals and surprisingly find a lot of grammatical errors which make reading difficult.More importantly the take home message is often not clear so it may be advisable for someone else to independently go through the paper.I often give the paper to some nontechnical person to read and am surprised at the number of typographical/grammatical errors that creep up which can at times even change the meaning and  sometimes a fresh pair of eyes s required.

"Hello everyone,_x0007__x0007_I know that many of you have already complained about poor peer grading, and I'd like to share my experience with you. This post is NOT to complain for the grades (that are quite high, so I'm really satisfied with them), but to open a discussion about the usefulness of the grading systems as it is at the moment._x0007__x0007_For writing assignment 2, I submitted the introduction of a paper I am drafting. The peer grading were the following:_x0007__x0007_GRADER 1 --> 15/15, no comments or corrections on the essay _x0007__x0007_GRADER 2 --> 13/15, no comments or corrections on the essay _x0007__x0007_GRADER 3 --> 13/15, no comments or corrections on the essay _x0007__x0007_I decided to resubmit the same essay for writing assignment 3 (in the hope of receiving some usefull suggestions/comments); I edited it a little bit, but I couldn't do much becasue I had no feedback from the first 3 reviewers. Some minutes ago I got the peer grading for assignament 3:_x0007__x0007_GRADER 4 --> 15/15, no comments or corrections on the essay _x0007__x0007_GRADER 5 --> 13/15, no comments or corrections on the essay _x0007__x0007_GRADER 6 --> 10/15, no comments or corrections on the essay (and this one really made me angry: he/she graded the essay as boring, non-compelling, confused, inconsistent, full of clutter...and left NO comment ?!?!?!?!?)_x0007__x0007_So, the point is that my essay was reviewer by 6 different people, got grades ranging from 10 (indicating a rather poor quality of writing) to 15 (perfection), and NO ONE gave me a single suggestion about how to improve it. So, in the end, I don't know the real quality of my writing, and I've got no feedback about how to improve it. This makes me think that the peer-grading system in this course is completely useless and is not a learning tool.

We are therefore reliant on the integrity of participants - I don't know the answer to making everyone do it correctly but perhaps looking at alternative ways might help - this time I edited externally and pasted my reviewed version into the system (downside- no standard mark-ups but comments for each of the participants, a virtual re-write for 2 and substantial edits throughout all 4 and avoiding all the system bugs meant it took much less time and no marking changes!). _x0007__x0007_It would be nice if there were some type of checking system that related score to editing - a score of 15 requiring none or little but more and more edits required as the score reduces (a percentage of the initial word count perhaps?).

A reviewer feedback system would be useful too even if it was as simple as - I find this review helpful/unhelpful/unnecessary -at least then, the reviewer gets some feedback on their work and the reviewee (is that a word?) may feel better by being able to comment directly._x0007__x0007_Although of concern to all, those who are genuinely at the lower end of the ability range need the most feedback on this type of task in order that they can improve their writing skills.

Did they mention about the time frame for this final exam?_x0007_Is there any start and possible due date of completion?_x0007_anybody know anything?,0,1,1
"Our peers are reviewing our essays based on the lessons of this course. So, it might work against you if you followed the kind of format you have described.",1,0,1
Yes they have. Start is Novemver 15 and due date is Nov 22,1,0,1
"Dear Kristin,_x0007__x0007_I had read in one of the discussions that there will an MCQ Test in Week 8.. scheduled to be released today i.e. 15th November. It carries 20% weightage. I thought it would be released by now. I don't see it on my page._x0007__x0007_Is it rescheduled? Please let me know._x0007__x0007_Thanks for everything!",0,1,1
It is still <zipRedac>4 November at Stanford U!_x0007_http://worldtime.io/current/stanford_university_stanford_ca_<zipRedac>4305_usa/<zipRedac>2<zipRedac>542?p=2,1,0,1
"What I feel is by the end of the course, all of us will have some wonderful learning experiences - mostly useful and some amusing. (One peer-reviewer who gave me 15/15 also gave me some encouraging comments, and the second one who gave the same score gave me some useful suggestions whereas the third reviewer who gave me 1/15 gave no comments, but made a lot of mistakes by way of editing!). I got the grade I deserve plus some encouraging feedback, and some stuff to have fun!!!",1,0,1
I think this person simply made a mistake while submitting the essay...,1,0,1
"Hi,_x0007_I've resubmitted my essay 3, but beneath new text I can still see grades I've recieved for 1st version and the same situation is in my progress panel. After new submission I was informed to grade 4 extra essays (so totally 8), and I've done it. Could you please check what is wrong and unblock new peers' feedback._x0007__x0007_Best,",1,1,1
Mention that the current data are unknown.,1,0,1
"My essay for assignment 3 has been flagged. I think it would be helpful if there was an indication as to what's the reason for flagging an essay._x0007__x0007_So I guess I'll just wait for the staff to check it out, right?",0,1,1
"I think it is not our job to check in this course if the presented scientific findings are correct. We are just checking that the essays are written properly._x0007__x0007_But of course if you are selected for a peer review of a journal article, then you should check as well if the statistics is properly applied in the paper. If you cannot do that yourself then get help from someone else or reject to do the peer review.",1,0,1
Even same with me,1,0,1
"As you suspected all flagged work is reviewed by staff before being either released for further review or banned. Flagging occurs when the reviewer has checked the plagiarism suspected or offensive content box. There doesn't appear to be any requirement for a comment indicating the reason for flagging, although I think it would be a useful inclusion - at a minimum it could be used to direct those checking in the right direction.",1,0,1
The same thing happened to me as well. I think we should be given another chance to compensate this issue.,1,0,1
"I did not claim that it is not possible to give useful comments to someone who wrote a 15 point essay. But there are many people out there who are happy to write a 9 point essay, and they might not feel that they can help someone who already wrote a 15 point essay. _x0007__x0007_But of course you are right: even if someone writes 6 point essays, he should write comments into the essays of others. I had comments in my essays where the reviewer clearly did not understand very simple things that I described. My first reaction was \such an idiot\"", but the second thought was \""how could he possible have misunderstood that?\"". And the latter is a useful approach: sometimes you've used an ambiguous term that was misunderstood, or the structure of the sentence was a litle bit misleading. These thing are best spotted by inexperienced people (or idiots, excuse my language here), but at the same time you'll improve the manuscript if you sort these things out!""",1,0,1
"I sent my first assignment as assignment 3, so of course there are similarities in the text, I just edited it. I'm very curious about the reason for the flagging... Thank you for answering!",1,0,1

I have the same problem. Same scores and same comments.,0,1,1
"Hi to all, _x0007_Thank you for creating this great course and for revising my assays. Most of your comments were really useful especially because I’m a non- native writer.

"It depends on your domain. In biology (my domain) nobody cares what you publish in a conference--this maybe exaggerate a little bit but since conferences are not peer reveiwed, people will not consider these results as final \true\"" results, and also many people avoid communicate their newest results in a conference because someone eles could working on the same thing and have their similar results, so you don't want them know your prgress. However, There are very prestigeous conferences in some dimain, such as CS and EE (and physics?), and these results are peer reviewed (from what I heard), it is also considered as high impact pulications if you get your results into one of those meetings.

I commented that the peer review ought to be de-emphasized vis-a-vis \grade\"". 50% of the course grade is a heavy price to pay. Since the reviewer is not a trained editor, much of the resulting grades are 'random'. Editing our peer's work was a unique experience and I feel that many of the students here tried to be as objective and honest as possible. Except for one. I received a review of my intro-rewrite for #3. In the review I was referred to in a derogatory fashion(un-subtle form of bullying). Furthermore this reviewer proceeded to remark about trivial changes to my paper and gave me an 8! None of my submissions were ever below 10 (that I recall), even with the software bugs that caused so many zeroes._x0007__x0007_I doubt that much can be done about the bully: some people just weren't raised right. But I do hope you reconsider, you know, during the Monday-morning meetings... adjustments to the weight of the grade offered to the peer review.

Thanks to Kristin and everybody behind the course. _x0007__x0007_I'd like to say though, that after having scored 89%, I'm thinking that if I hadn't been honest during the self-assessment quizzes, I would have ended up with 90% --because there was 1 question that I marked against myself. _x0007__x0007_Further, I feel that many of my essays were marked unfairly. They were given extremely low marks, which brought my middle-score down substantially. I am a professional journalist and have been editing/revising academic texts for 7 years. I've been published as a primary author in BMJ, Lancet and the WHO Bulletin. I know what bad writing is (including my own, when I'm too pressed for time to improve it), and my essays did not deserve 8's and 10's. _x0007__x0007_So, I feel that the peer assessments --while probably necessary for this wonderful, free, and packed course-- can be unfair because of ... well, because there are a lot of haters out there.

Not only grading peer reviews (I apologize to whomever I graded and the glitch happened), but also homework submissions, homework deadlines and any other technical glitches that have been listed.

But we all went through exactly the same system (admittedly not the same reviewers) but those who were really affected by the 'glitches' will be much closer to 50% (low scores on all essays) and may not even get a Certificate of Accomplishment - I don't see lots of complaints from them. Everyone who is close to 90% should remember that they have done really well regardless of whether they think their scores were fair or not.,1,0,1
but you did really well to get 89.3% Zebabaqtiyar - if you were saying I got 59.3% and I won't get a certificate of accomplishment because all my essay scores were low I might be more inclined to agree (by the way I haven't seen a single complaint about this) but you must have achieved around 40% in the essays which means that neither score was really badly affected and probably reflects a realistic grade (even if you consider your work better),1,0,1

"I really enjoyed this course. I am grateful to Professor Kristin <redacted> and all the soldiers behind this great project. You are serving humanity by disseminating knowledge!! Imagine how many junior researches will benefit from this course to move science forward!! I am sure I have thousands of classmates who share me the same opinion.

For those who are frustrated with the peer review (I do agree it’s sometimes unfair and unprofessional), try looking at the big picture! This course reshaped my way of thinking and breached the fear I had towards scientific writing.
